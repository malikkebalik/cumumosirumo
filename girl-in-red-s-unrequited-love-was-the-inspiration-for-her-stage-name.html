Her divorced parents brought her up along with her sisters. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Speaking to Them magazine in September 2019, the Queer icon <a href=# rel="follow noopener">described</a> her childhood to be nothing short of boring. She always felt left out even though she had friends and family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I was always bored growing up; I had friends, but I always felt like I wasn’t a part of anything. I felt like nothing had meaning.</p><p>And that is also one of the reasons how Girl in Red started making music. Now, she feels the music that she makes is part of herself.</p><h2>Her Stage Name Is Inspired From A Story With Her Best Friend</h2><p>Those who have listened to Marie Ulven’s songs, call her by her stage name, Girl in Red. But many might not know the story behind the name.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Norwegian indie-pop singer-songwriter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> the truth behind her stage name during an interview with Complex Magazine in February 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She remembered the day back in 2017 when she was to meet her best friend at a festival but could not find her due to the massive crowd. After a lot of hustle and texts [writing “Where are you?”], she saw her in a red sweater.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>With her friend in front of her, Ulven quickly referred to her as “girl in red” and also texted the same to her friend.</p><p>She just came a little bit closer. She was wearing a red sweater. I just said, “girl in red.” I texted her, “girl in red.” I have a screenshot so I have proof that it happened in 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Some months after that event, she bought a red sweater (a red turtleneck) for herself and took a photo at school saying, “girl in red.” And that was the moment when she discovered her stage name. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I was like, “Holy [Expletive]. This is it man.”</p><h2>Her Best Friend Is Her Unrequited Love: 'I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend'</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Girl in Red was in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unrequited</a> love with her best friend, whose red sweater inspired the queer singer to her stage name.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The 21-year-old singer even dedicated a song expressing her love for her best friend. The song was none other than her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">debut single</a> ‘I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend.’</p><p>Unrequited love. That’s also what&nbsp;“I&nbsp;wanna be your girlfriend” song is about. It’s about me falling in love with my straight best friend and how I just really wanted to see her that summer, but she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t meet her once and I was so [Expletive] sad.</p><p>The song that was released on SoundCloud in November 2016 was about her falling in love with her straight best friend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGijoJqknr5ws8iro2ahnmK%2FprCMq5yapF2jrq6xjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
