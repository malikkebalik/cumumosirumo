Joshua Tree in southeastern California is known for its otherworldly desert landscape — and where better to escape for a night than in a flying saucer-shaped home.
“It’s the third [house of its kind] in California, but it’s the only one open for people to come and experience,” said owner Ronald Jackson. 
Renting for $223 night on Airbnb, this epic spaceman house is booked out through early 2022."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That wasn’t as easy as you might think: Futuro Pods are difficult to acquire, and after traveling to Australia and Pennsylvania, he finally purchased a shell in fragmented disrepair in Wisconsin for close to $30,000, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>.</p><p>In a past life, the dome resided at the first Playboy Club Hotel in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and was a favorite of <a href=#>Hugh Hefner’s</a>.
