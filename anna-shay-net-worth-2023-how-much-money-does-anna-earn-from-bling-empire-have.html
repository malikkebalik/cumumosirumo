Shay didn’t talk about her family’s life in public until after they died.

I didn’t do anything except being born. It’s my parents. My dad is from the South Side of Chicago. My mother is from the aristocracy. Those two are amazing. They’re not here, but they’re here. My mother said, ‘You were born in a crystal ball with a silver spoon.”&nbsp;</p><p>“To this day, I don’t understand the concept of this. How could somebody go up and say, ‘Can I sponsor this?’ It’s so embarrassing. I just walk away, like, I don’t know this person.”</p><p>“Very happy for everybody. Did I expect the show to be successful? No. I wasn’t even expecting to be in front of the camera. I’m very shy, and I went along with whatever situation was happening. It was just me. I think the success of the show has a lot to do with how Netflix.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t think so. I have nothing against Christine. Met Christine nine, ten years ago while going to Fashion Week. I knew a different side of Christine then. During the show, however, she wanted to portray things — I just went with whatever she said.”</p><p>“Decided to have a party, and if anything, [the wrong time was] probably meant for me because I’m always late. I always say, when friends call me for dinner, ‘Don’t tell me the real-time!’”&nbsp;</p><p>“I believe that one creates their own style. It doesn’t matter if you’re wearing something from Target or Chanel. There’s only one thing that I wouldn’t wear. It’s something straight off of a mannequin because the mannequin is a size zero.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read more</strong> :</p><ul><li><a href=#>Bling Empire Season 3 Potential Return Date: Everything You Need To Know</a></li><li><a href=#>Net Worths Of The All Bling Empire Cast – Who Is The Richest Member Of Bling Empire?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5a7r62MrJ%2BasV2jsrV51qipraBfaIF1gZNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
