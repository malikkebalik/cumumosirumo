You can click on a family name and trace the tree branches, clicking on a specific character’s name and get information about him/her, including a bio, marriages & affairs, crimes, and list of every relative, including the nature of the relationship (parent, child, cousin, etc. )</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>PAFan</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 16, 2016, 1:45am <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>I just started to watch Days again ( I watched this show when Julie was Julie Olsen Banning) since it is now on at 8 pm on a cable channel. I watched it on and off for years when I could. I remember a story line where John was the child of Stefano DiMiera’s father and Shawn Brady’s sister who later became a nun. So, John is Stefano’s half brother. Why is he looking for his mother? And Andre, wasn’t he Stefano’s nephew . He kidnapped Tony, (I think that was his name) Stefano’s son and kept him hostage on an island.</p><img alt width=20 height=20 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/7ba0ec/40.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> PAFan:<p>I just started to watch Days again ( I watched this show when Julie was Julie Olsen Banning) since it is now on at 8 pm on a cable channel.

I don’t know. I too clearly remember that John was Stefano’s half-brother. This is just another unexplained re-write/re-telling of John’s history.</p><p>Thanks everyone for the info, I love reading about all the background and such even if I’m clear on the details there’s always new bits to learn. I started watching Day’s back in the 90’s, and then would catch it here and there. Started watching again in 2009 on a regular basis (thank you DVR). Lately I just seem to be focusing on how everyone’s related and such.</p><p>I think it’s important to remember that whatever source consulted to check out a family tree, or bio for a particular DOOL character, may contain errors and/or omissions. That usually happens because the writers tend to surprize us with new characters at will–often previously unknown relatives. It must be hard for whoever compiles these sources to keep the information current! I have found the soapcentral website and our own Character Listings generally accurate, but in both of them I’ve found minor inaccuracies or information that should be updated (especially the addition of “new” relatives).</p><p>There are always ongoing Spoilers revealing that certain newcomers are due in Salem in the near future. We cannot expect those names to be identified in a Family Tree until they actually arrive. And it may take a while before we see their names listed–as it did on two sources that I know of–with Victor’s previously unknown second brother and nephew “Xander.” (I believe there’s to be still another Kiriakis relative sprung on us soon.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvCrqmrnZ6peqetzKKjsmWkp7Kmv45tam9waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
