If we throwback to three months ago, she and her husband <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/reallilscrappy/?utm_source=ig_embed">posted a touching image</a> to welcome their baby daughter Xylo Richardson.</p><p class=dh>The times of intense fights on camera with her reality co-stars and the unsteady relationship with her actual husband seem to have been left behind in the past. They are both now moving forward in personal projects and pursuing their own life and goals.</p><p class=dh>While she was shooting season 6 of “Love & Hip-Hop: Atlanta”, Benson declared that she had enough of drama. Now Benson, who has a college degree in journalism, is focusing on being a full-time mom, her music, and her beauty brands.</p><p class=dh>Unlike the rest of us, 2020 brought a new member to the Scrappy-Benson family. In April, Lil Scrappy and Benson celebrated a gender reveal in their backyard. The private celebration was decorated with Lakers colors -purple and yellow- to commemorate basketball’s superstar Kobe Bryant.</p><p class=dh>After 10 minutes of painful contractions and pushing 7 lbs 5 oz out of her womb, baby girl Xylo –or Mambacita as her dad <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CHImga3juDc/>calls her in a post</a>- came into the world.

However, this new baby girl has already taken all daddy’s and mommy’s attention.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MOTHER, MUSICIAN, AND ENTREPRENEUR</strong></p><p class=dh>Besides motherhood, Lil Scrappy’s wife is focused on her music career. As her husband, Benson is also a rapper and collaborated with great hip-hop stars like 50 Cent and Lil Wayne.</p><p class=dh>The singer of “I´m Cute” and “Hustler Hard” is an unstoppable and empowered businesswoman. The TV star looks <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.earnthenecklace.com/who-is-bambi-from-love-hip-hop-atlanta/>always on top</a>. From her hair to her outfit and make-up, it isn’t strange that this woman bet for a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CCgpiP-lsMI/>new beauty initiative.</a></p><p class=dh>Lil Scrappy’s partner has her attention centered on her brand Shimmer Elite Extensions for hair, wearing its products very often in her posts on social media.
