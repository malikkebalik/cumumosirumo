On December 7, 2023, Keisha Nash Whitaker departed from this life. She passed away at 51 years old. Sonnet’s father Forest and her sister True Whitaker both confirmed Keisha’s passing on Instagram. The Harlem actress True’s godfather wrote:</p><p>“goodbye mommy. I love you 4ever and beyond”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/Sonnet%20Noel%20Whitaker's%20mother%20Keisha%20Nash%20Whitaker%20died%20at%20the%20age%20of%2051-1702371917403.jpg"><p>The cause of Keisha’s death has not been disclosed by the family spokesman. According to several online publications, her anorexia caused her death. True, though, has dispelled the gossip and declared that it had nothing to do with her mother’s passing.</p><p>True has been brave in dealing with the media despite all of this sadness and pain. However, Sonnet remains unreachable by the media.</p><h2>Early Years and Education</h2><p>Los Angeles, California, was the place of Sonnet Noel Whitaker’s birth on October 3, 1996. Her parents, the late Keisha Nash Whitaker and Forest Whitaker, had her as their first child.</p><p>Sonnet undoubtedly holds a particular place in her parents’ affections as the first daughter. On Instagram, Forest, a pleased father, talked about Sonnet’s debut record. Sonnet has had a quiet profile since she was a young girl. Therefore, not much information about her early life, including her education, is available to the general public.</p><h2 id=sonnet-noel-whitaker-siblings>Sonnet Noel Whitaker Siblings</h2><p>Ocean, Autumn, and True Whitaker are the three siblings with whom Noel Whitaker grew up. Born on July 2, 1998, True is Sonnet’s sole full-sibling. Compared to her sibling, True is two years younger. True has pursued acting, just like their parents. She costarred with Forest in the drama series Godfather of Harlem on American television.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/Sonnet%20Noel%20Whitaker%20with%20her%20siblings%20and%20parents-1702372251879.jpg><p>The life of American mobster Bumpy Johnson serves as the basis for the TV show. True is active on social networking sites like Instagram, in contrast to Sonnet. She has more than 9,000 followers on her Instagram account, @truewhitaker.</p><p>Sonnet’s eldest half-sibling is Ocean. On April 13, 1990, he was born out of Forest’s prior relationship. Similarly, Keisha’s previous connection produced Autumn, her half-sister, who was born in 1991.</p><h2>Professional Career of Sonnet Noel Whitaker:</h2><h3>Music Ventures</h3><p>Sonnet Noel Whitaker is more of a music enthusiast, despite having acting credits on her IMDb profile. She has always had a fascination with the music business. Sonnet is a singer-songwriter who has put out a few tracks as of late.</p><p></p><p>Mischief Grace, Sonnet’s debut album, was released in 2013. Similar to this, some of her other songs are available on music streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify, such as Lights.</p><p>Regarding his first child, Forest stated:</p><p>While she didn’t inherit the acting bug, Sonnet lived up to her musical name and became a musician.</p><p>Even Forest Whitaker, the pleased father, used Instagram to announce Sonnet’s album NFS. He penned</p><p>I’m so proud of my incredible daughter Sonnet for writing and recording N.F.S., her first album!</p><h3>Television Series & Films</h3><p>Sonnet Noel Whitaker is not as involved in the acting world as another member of her family. She was not born with the acting gene, as Forest Whitaker once said. On her IMDb site, the famous daughter does, however, list one acting credit.</p><p>Yes, Sonnet made a fleeting cameo in the film First Daughter in 2004. In the film, she played the laughing girl. She hasn’t pursued acting since then.</p><h2 id=is-sonnet-noel-whitaker-married?>Is Sonnet Noel Whitaker Married?</h2><p>There is no record of Sonnet Noel Whitaker’s marriages. Furthermore, it doesn’t appear that First Daughter actress Sonnet is dating anyone right now.</p><p>Whitaker would rather not talk about her love life in public. Furthermore, it has been challenging to determine Sonnet’s relationship status due to her lack of presence on social media sites. In terms of her parents’ marriage, it came to an end in 2018 after 22 years of union.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/Sonnet%20Noel%20Whitaker's%20parents%20remained%20married%20for%2022%20years-1702371681097.jpg"><h3>Sonnet Noel Whitaker Parents Divorce Reason</h3><p>The first time Forest and Keisha Whitaker saw one other was in 1994. Sonnet Noel Whitaker’s parents met on the set of the movie Blown Away since they are both former actors. In 1996, Sonnet’s parents exchanged vows in Jamaica’s Montego Bay.</p><p>Before the actor from The Last King of Scotland filed for divorce in 2018, the couple were wed for 22 years. What caused Keisha and Forest’s divorce? Forest, however, claimed that their divorce was due to irreconcilable disagreements. Even after they separated, Sonnet’s parents continued to be there for one another.</p><h2>Social Media: Instagram</h2><p>There is no way to access Sonnet Noel Whitaker on Instagram or any other social media network. In a similar vein, she hardly ever appears in public. Sonnet is therefore able to keep a low profile despite being a niece of Kenn Whitaker and one of Forest Whitaker’s children.</p><p>Whitaker cherishes her personal time and seclusion. She dislikes showing off anything on social media. Sonnet is nevertheless highlighted on her family’s Instagram account.</p><p><strong>you may also like </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Danny Worsnop-Singer-Songwriter| Net Worth Age, Height, Relationship, Career and Wiki!.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKufo7umwIynpp6kXay1qsDApJyrZaOeu6ix0WaqqKaXrL%2BqwMSrZLChm556orPEZp%2BeoZedwW66xK1ksKeiqbVuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZpytoJ6esKrA2GaamqqVmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
