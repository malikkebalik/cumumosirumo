Marc lived in New Jersey until he was 6, when his father joined the U.S. Air Force and relocated his family to Alaska for two years. After his tenure there, Marc and his family relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico. After high school, Marc enrolled in Boston University. He graduated in 1986 with a B.A. in English Literature. Marc began his stand-up career when he was 24. He worked at the The Comedy Store in Los Angeles before moving to New York City to be part of the Alternative Comedy scene in the late 80’s/early 90’s. Marc’s stand-up led to appearances on Dr. Katz and Short Attention Span Theater. He also recorded half-hour specials for Comedy Central and HBO. His only major film credit is that of ‘angry promoted’ in 2000’s Almost Famous. In 2004, Marc co-hosted Morning Sedition, a morning radio show on Air America. One year after Morning Sedition went off the air in 2005, Marc began hosting The Marc Maron Show on KTLK in Los Angeles. He returned to Air America in 2008 but was let go in 2009. That year, Marc started the WTF podcast. The show has reached No.1 on the iTunes comedy section numerous times and has given Marc’s career a second life.
