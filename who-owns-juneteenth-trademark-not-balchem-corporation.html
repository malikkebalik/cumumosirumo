Although chemical company Balchem Corp. applied for the trademark, the company has since abandoned it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Retail giant <a href=#>Walmart</a> has been taking some flack for releasing a Juneteenth-themed ice cream. Critics see the product as an attempt to profit from the holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery and the Black culture. Of particular concern to some is the word “Juneteenth” is trademarked for Balchem Corp. on the Walmart ice cream. Who owns the <a href=#>Juneteenth</a> trademark?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Balchem's trademark for Juneteenth was abandoned.</h2><p>According to the Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Balchem Corporation filed paperwork to trademark “Juneteenth” on September 2, 2021. However, records show the company abandoned the trademark on May 23, about the same time the controversy over the Walmart Juneteenth-themed ice cream started brewing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Balchem Corporation is a New York-based chemical company that “delivers customized ingredient systems and key minerals and nutrients for the food, supplement, and pharmaceutical markets,” states the company website. Information filed with the Trademark office says the company creates flavor enhancers used in food and beverage products.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Consumers complain that white-owned company is profiting from the Black holiday.</h2><p>Those upset about the <a href=#>Juneteenth</a> ice cream also were concerned that a white-owned corporation tried to trademark the name of a holiday celebrating Black history.</p><p>“Balchem Corp trademarked #Juneteeth in 2021. When does this shit end? Pass this along. Boycott ALL of their products. Let them know this isnt ok,” tweeted Afro.Beer.Chick.</p><p>“Can someone trademark Christmas? Anything to be done about this? I’m tempted to fight it personally,” tweeted Laura Dierks.</p><p>“We CANNOT let these colonizers own ‘JUNETEENTH,’” tweeted Black Majority State Migration Contraband.</p><p>Several on social media recommended Walmart shoppers looking for ice cream buy the <a href=#>Creamalicious</a> brand instead. Creamalicious is an ice cream brand carried by Walmart that is from a Black-owned, female-owned company.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Juneteenth recognizes the end of slavery.</h2><p>Black Americans have been celebrating Juneteenth every year on June 19 since 1865. The event commemorates the day when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, heard of their emancipation. Texas was the last state in the Confederacy to have slavery. Last year, President Joe Biden declared Juneteenth a national holiday.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In all seriousness......<br>If you have seen the Juneteenth Ice Cream from Walmart, go ahead and grab some Creamalicious Red Velvet Cheesecake instead! Walmart could have used this opportunity to highlight this brand instead of making a cheap copycat for OUR Independence Day. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/avlIkjvoOU</a></p>— ThatBoyTay (@lifeofvontay) <a href=#>May 23, 2022</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter / @lifeofvontay</a></figure><p>“Juneteenth is a day of profound weight and power. A day in which we remember the moral stain and terrible toll of slavery on our country –- what I’ve long called America’s original sin. A long legacy of systemic racism, inequality, and inhumanity,” President Biden said in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proclamation</a>. “But it is a day that also reminds us of our incredible capacity to heal, hope, and emerge from our darkest moments with purpose and resolve.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Walmart pulled the Juneteenth ice cream from its shelves.</h2><p>After complaints flooded social media channels, <a href=#>Walmart</a> pulled the Juneteenth ice cream off its shelves. “Juneteenth holiday marks a celebration of freedom and independence. However, we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers, and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate," the company said in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaK%2BYpHqww82sZKOtnprBprHNrZ9mrKKWsaa5wKuiaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
