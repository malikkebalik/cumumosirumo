He also carries his rock influences into the project.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“The production feels aggressive but still sexy,” he said. “The Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, Prince, and DeBarge play roles. We wrote it all in Los Angeles. I think it’ll be the best-sounding album I’ve ever done. It’s hard to label&nbsp;the sound because, when I first came out, nobody would label it R&B. I just want to keep pushing the envelope without it feeling forced.”</p><p>Beauty Behind The Madness is certified triple platinum a year after its release. The project featured hit singles that have sold more than one million copies each, including the seven-times platinum “<a href=#>The Hills</a>.”</p><p>View The Weeknd’s <i>Starboy&nbsp;</i>cover art below.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2016/09/The-Weeknd-Starboy-album-cover-art.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZkZYJyfI6toK2klWPBqbGMsJyeo56ZeqK6zaisp5uVqHq0wMCrmaixXZa5o8HMZqqhmaKawG6vzq%2Bcq2WRp8E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
