For her performances, the ventriloquist brought along her puppet friends.</p><p class=dh>They included flirty Edna, shy Oscar, and the energetic Petunia. Farmer surprised audience members by preparing a new song for Petunia to sing.</p><p class=dh>"I'm only 13 years old; I don't know anything about opera. Besides, I don't speak Italian."</p><p class=dh>After bringing out the cute white bunny, the ventriloquist asked her what she'd like to do next. Petunia responded, "I thought it would be nice to do some Italian opera!"</p><p class=dh>The teenager looked shocked and told the puppet that she didn’t know any Italian let alone how to sing opera. Petunia responded, "Sure you do! Haven't you ever been to Olive Garden?"</p><p class=dh>Then the puppet showed off all the Italian she knew thanks to the dishes served at Olive Garden like rigatoni, spaghetti, lasagna, and linguini. This somewhat made Farmer relent and the song began.</p><p class=dh>After just a few lyrics, the sold-out audience went wild, shocked by the young teenager's talent. She continued to sing the beautiful soprano opera that had her hitting notes without even opening her mouth.</p><p class=dh>At the same time, she kept a perfect vibrato and managed to move Petunia around as well. The performance was amazing and the crowd loved every minute of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnBscGtnYsSww4yanq1lp567r7HRZpuaqpOeeq3FzaecZq%2BfrMBur9Gorp1lmal7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
