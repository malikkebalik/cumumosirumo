After a hard day’s work, she woke up to the congratulatory texts and calls from her&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Saint Maud&nbsp;teammates spread across diverse time zones.&nbsp;</p><p>Clark, who was still in bed, finally realized that she was nominated for the prestigious award.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>When she finally got a hold of her senses, she realized the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gravity&nbsp;</a>of the accolade. More so when she saw contemporaries like Sope Dirisu and Kingsley Ben-Adir on the nomination list. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When&nbsp;Flickering Myth&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">asked </a>her if she had come to grips with the honor, the star replied she was told about her nomination, but it didn’t quite register then. She recalled feeling numb and zoned out. But when she read the names alongside her, it dawned on her that she was now a part of something bigger.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/IMG20210328180118.jpg width=484 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Morfydd Clark </strong>(Source:&nbsp;Morfydd Clark's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Clark Hasn’t Had the Time to Celebrate</h2><p>Needless to say that the title of&nbsp;EE Rising Star&nbsp;is an honorable one and being nominated for one is a notable achievement. That being said, Clark has not been able to&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;her success because she has been busy with her current project.</p><p>In contrast, Clark also commented that the world’s situation does not warrant her to have fun; as the world goes through turbulence, it felt wrong to her to experience something extremely positive.&nbsp;</p><h2>The ‘EE Rising Star’ Award&nbsp;</h2><p>The&nbsp;EE Rising Star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Award&nbsp;</a>is the only honor in the roster of BAFTA that is influenced by public opinion.
