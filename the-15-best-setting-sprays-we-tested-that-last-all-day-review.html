Now, it just has to last…</p><p>Thanks to the formulas made possible by some of the best makeup setting sprays at in-store beauty counters and online (thank you <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Amazon</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Sephora</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Ulta Beauty</a>), the stress of will my makeup last all day? is under wraps and taken care of by careful setting sprays.</p><p>Much like your favorite<a href=#> makeup primer</a>, a setting spray is intended to be the final touch to your careful artistry — the nightcap to your cocktail night, the powdered sugar on the brownie (you get the idea).</p><p>That said, we have been testing makeup setting sprays <strong>for more than a year</strong>, outlining the 15 that made the cut and lasted practically all day.</p><p>“A setting spray should help make the makeup last the majority of the day,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Natalie Dresher</a>, a special event makeup artist, told The Post. “I would say from application to the end of the ‘typical’ workday.”</p><p>Not to mention, Dresher, who has done bridal makeup for more than eight years, definitely knows the importance of making makeup last all day, especially when working on clients for the biggest day of their lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What makes a setting spray “good”?</h2><p>“I know if a setting spray is good if my makeup doesn’t transfer as much onto clothing (like a mask, or the collar of my shirt),” Dresher adds. “Trial and error are key when picking out makeup products because they really are so personal.”</p><p>That said, I spritzed and sprayed for days to create a list of the best makeup setting sprays. Using the same exact makeup products (a full face of liquids, powders and highlights), I checked in each hour to take notes when my face became oily or a bit streaky.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to apply setting spray</h2><p>“I apply in a snowflake formation so I hit the top, bottom and sides of my face without drowning and potentially ruining my makeup, about four spritzes,” Dresher recommends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best setting sprays we tested in 2023</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Urban Decay All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray</a>, $36</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/1-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 15 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>I’m a big believer that if a certain product is widely talked about, there’s a good reason for it — and Urban Decay’s All-Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray is a prime example that deserves all the praise.</p><p>Not only is it vegan, waterproof and a community favorite but it’s the setting spray if you want your makeup to lock into place seamlessly and without a minute’s worry throughout the day. It also lasted me from 9 a.m. to midnight — not budging or making my face shiny throughout a bus ride, a restaurant dinner and a concert.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Urban Decay All Nighter Ultra Matte Makeup Setting Spray</a>, $36</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/2-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 15 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>If you prefer a long-lasting matte finish, Urban Decay’s riveting All Nighter Makeup Setting Spray comes in a formulated matte spritzer just for you. It also lasted me just as long (15 hours!) and I’ll turn to this if I want a more natural-looking makeup look, particularly on days when I’m not brushing and blending into full-glam mode.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Anastasia Beverly Hills Dewy Set Setting Spray</a>, $26</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/ds-1.png><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 7 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>If you’re anything like me, you goo-goo and ga-ga over all things Anastasia Beverly Hills (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we reviewed nearly all the brand’s products</a>). Pretty gold sparkles aside, this setting spray works. It lasted for pretty much an entire workday, reapplying in the late afternoon for a midday pick-me-up.</p><p>What’s more, it has a fresh scent and, much like its packaging, leaves the most subtle glimmery glow that is a more refreshing and take on the “wet” finish some sprays leave.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Benefit Cosmetics The Pore-Minimizing Setting Spray</a>, $27 to $33</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/4-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 7 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>For fans of Benefit Cosmetics’ universal favorite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">makeup primer</a>, rejoice. The Pore-Minimizing Setting Spray is just as good: lightweight and resembling more of a mist.</p><p>Though I applied a tad more spritzes of this than Dresher’s recommended snowflake method, I appreciate how seamless, airy and effective it is; my makeup truly looked flawless throughout the day.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray</a>, $36 to $38</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/5-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 11 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>All hail Queen Charlotte. Seriously, I would bow down to this makeup setting spray if I could.</p><p>Everything about this finisher is full-on couture, from its luxe packaging to its fresh, floral scent. It makes my makeup the most glowy and Hollywood-esque (which makes sense, given the brand has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Hollywood Flawless Filter</a> ($44) that’s so popular, it’s nearly sold out.</p><p>The Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray is one of my go-to’s and I recommend spraying it a bit further from the face than usual, as it sprays wetter than most. The dewy, rejuvenating spray also has that it-factor that some of the other options I tested.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Hourglass Veil Setting Spray</a>, $49</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/6-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 9 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>I’ve been a fan of Hourglass for years, from its regal-looking <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>powder blushes</a> ($43) to its array of easy-to-apply <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>face products</a>. Its Veil Setting Spray is quite the long-lasting gem in the bunch, giving you a natural finish that’s slightly dewy.</p><p>Though I resort to its matching <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Mineral Primer</a> ($56) more frequently, I enjoy using this spray on days when I need my makeup to last long but am not looking for an intense glam beauty look.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>It Cosmetics It’s Your Skin But Better Setting Spray</a>, $20 to $29</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/7-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 8 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>After testing It Cosmetics’ It’s Your Skin But Better Setting Spray, I was impressed with how long it lasted. It’s also infused with hyaluronic acid, coconut water and aloe vera extract, an ingredient trifecta that made my skill feel livened up.</p><p>This makeup setting spray was effective on my dry and sensitive skin, though my face became super oily after eight hours, more than others. But, a quick spray again will help diminish some shine.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Lancome Fix It Forget It Setting Spray</a>, $34</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/8-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 4 hours without reapplying; another 4 hours after that</li></ul><p>Lancome’s Fix It Forget It Setting Spray is a treasure among others, despite it not lasting as long as competing formulas. Perhaps it was the fresh scent and the way it clung to my makeup, but I immediately thought, “This is what the pros use.”</p><p>It applied best when you go in an around-the-world motion instead of the traditional four sprays. It gave my skin one of the most noticeable soft glam finishes (which is why I still turn to it) and made me realize that a quality setting spray makes a large difference.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Lawless Glam Guard Long-Wear Setting Spray</a>, $20</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/9-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 6 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>For $20, Lawless’ Glam Guard Long-Wear Setting Spray is the ideal product to use if you want an effective formula that, in full-size form, is the perfect size to stash in your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">work bag</a> or purse. It has the scent and finish of a setting spray a professional MUA would use, too.</p><p>Above all, I loved how it was hydrating and offered the prime balance of lightness and effectiveness. My mascara smudged just a bit (not a dealbreaker), so I would recommend spraying further away from your face than usual.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>MAC Cosmetics Prep + Prime Fix+</a>, $31</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/10-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 10 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>MAC’s Fix+ brings me back to my middle school days when everyone and their mother were talking about (1) MAC Cosmetics as a whole and (2) this miracle product that doubles as a midday refresher and pre-makeup hydrant.</p><p>I wore this for a family bridal shower and it lasted throughout the party (before and even after, too). It looked natural and fresh in photos, too. It’s also one of those products you have to “wave dry” with your hands in the air, as it has a wetter finish than others.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>11. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Make Up For Ever Mist & Fix Hydrating Setting Spray</a>, $33</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/11-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 8 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>Make Up For Ever truly impressed me with its no-frills formula that, quite literally, locks your makeup and that’s it. The spray is powerful and the most like Urban Decay’s All-Nighter, though it didn’t last quite as long.</p><p>It gives an all-over matte finish that doesn’t look dull. And, by an all-over matte finish, I mean the spray is so powerful that it covers your entire face and neck with just four traditional spritzes. Plus, it’s perfect to pair with the brand’s new <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>HD Skin Undetectable Longwear Foundation</a> ($43).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>12. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>NYX Makeup Setting Spray</a>, $4 to $9</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/12-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 8 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>NYX — the impressive makeup brand that’s affordable and, without the label, you’d think is high-end. If you’re in a pinch and simply want your makeup to stay put, this product is for you.</p><p>If I had to compare it with another finisher from this list, it would be Make Up For Ever’s because it’s an ultra-powerful spray. However, it is rather wet, a subtle con, but does the job if you don’t want to break the bank.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>13. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Too Faced Hangover Rx 3-in-1 Replenishing Primer & Setting Spray</a>, $36</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/13-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 12 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>Too Faced does it yet again with its Hangover Rx 3-in-1 Replenishing Setting Spray because it’s also a primer (and yes, it’s just as effective). This glorious double-mist is an essential in your makeup collection if you want to save money without compromising that stay-in-place result.</p><p>It’s incredibly airy too and, because it left my face with a natural soft glam finish, it’s the best value in this list.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>14. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Ulta Wannabe Fresh Dewy Makeup Setting Spray</a>, $12</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/14-2.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 7 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>Catering more to the budget spenders, Ulta’s Wannabe Fresh Dewy Makeup Setting Spray surprised me by lasting for most of the work day. This may sound odd, but it sprays almost like Windex because its flushed formula sprays outward and hits every part of your face.</p><p>Though there was slight smudging of my mascara at first sprtiz, it’s still a quality product that works best when it’s sprayed further from the face. For $12, it’s a steal.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>15. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>caliray Surfproof Hydrating Setting Spray with Niacinamide</a>, $35</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/cr15.png><ul><li><strong>Hours lasted</strong>: 9 hours without reapplying</li></ul><p>Though I must admit I’ve never been surfing, the caliray Surfproof Hydrating Setting Spray with Niacinamide is one of the most impressive setting sprays I’ve used. Namely, it’s a lightweight and long-wear option that hardly budged. And, because it’s formulated with niacinamide for skin-boosting benefits, it receives the ultimate stamp of approval.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>Check out the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post Shopping</a> section for more content.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ5Gnwaqvy55mm52jqXq0sdOtoKefXai9s63YrGSrnaaesrh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
