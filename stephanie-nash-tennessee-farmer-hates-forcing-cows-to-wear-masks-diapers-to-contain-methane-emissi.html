Stephanie Nash said the people who came up with the idea have "gone to loony town." In mid-January this year, French dairy giant Danone announced that it intends to put masks and diapers on cows to trap their flatulence and burps in an effort to reduce their&nbsp;<a href=# rel>methane emissions</a> by at least 30% come 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>Nash termed the entire thing <a href=# rel>utter madness</a> on Wednesday, January 18, on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' "Well, Tucker, you know, I'm not going to wear a mask. I'm not going to allow my cows to wear a mask," she said, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox News.</a> During the interview, she even put a mask on one of her cows to test the theory but explained "she's not having it" and is "struggling to breathe."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Road Warrior's Road to Recovery: Texas woman rescues dog in critical condition from abandoned backpack</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Captain Kangaroo': North Dakota rep bashed for backing bill to fine trans people using 'wrong' pronouns</a></p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, livestocks which mainly include cows and cattle, produce methane, which is a dangerous <a href=# rel>greenhouse gas</a> that warms the atmosphere, as part of their normal digestive process. Livestock emissions fom manure and gastroenteric releases account for roughly 30% of the world's methane emissions, according to new data from the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nash told host Tucker Carlson that her farm is doing "big things to cut emissions." She explained, "We have ruminants on our farm that can digest byproducts. A good example is we feed our cows soybean meal that comes from soy oil production. And you have to ask yourself, millions of tons per year – if we don't have cows to digest that byproduct, it has to go somewhere. It has to go to a landfill. It has to go on, you know,&nbsp;into a waste management. And that's going to be very harmful. That's going to leave an imprint, you know, for our country and gases going into our environment."</p><p>Carlson questioned if putting a diaper on a cow is practical and wondered if the whole thing was a joke. "I think these people have gone to loony town. There's no possible way that I'm going to put a diaper on my cow," she stated.&nbsp;Nash said her cows have to be able to walk around freely, lay down, eat and drink water to live a comfortable life. "Our animals are under the best stewardship, and we want them to be as comfortable as possible. And telling me how to do my job is&nbsp;not the way to eliminate emissions. We have to be smart about this. We have to listen to the farmer [or] rancher and what is best for our animals."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq6SavamtzaKcZqaRqLVuwMSnpZ6ro5qybrLAq6Seql2Yv6rAyJygs52jYsGpsYyim56ZXaSzbrLOq5qippdisLDD0marqGWnmq6zecyaqqSrXZa7pXnDopipnaKo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
