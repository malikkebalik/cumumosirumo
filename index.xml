1997年のシングル「カウントダウン」で鮮烈デビューを果たし、一躍注目を集めました。
Coccoさんはキャリアのすべてが順調だったというわけではなく、私生活ではそれなりに苦難がありました。
若い頃から現在までのCoccoさんの結婚や彼氏・旦那の噂に関して調べるとともに、1999年4月に出産した子供（息子）Koto君との共演についてまとめました。
COCCOの壮絶な生い立ち。経歴・プロフィール。沖縄出身でバレエの英才教育 COCCOさんは女性シンガーソングライターですが、その他にも女優・絵本作家・エッセイスト・小説家としても活動されています。
名前：Cocco（読み：こっこ）
愛称：コッキー/あっちゃん/姫/コウ
別名：Cocko
生年月日：1977年1月19日
出身：沖縄県那覇市
血液型：O型
学歴： 沖縄県立開邦高等学校芸術科美術コース卒業
ジャンル： J-POP、オルタナティブ・ロック
職業： シンガーソングライター、女優、絵本作家、エッセイスト、小説家
担当楽器： ボーカル
活動期間： 1996年 - 2001年、2006年 -
100万目当てでオーディション。本当はバレリーナになりたかった Coccoさんは元々は歌手に憧れていたとか、歌が好きとかではない若者でした。
元々はプロのバレエダンサーを目指し、様々なオーディションを受けるもことごとく落選していたそうです。
歌手になったきっかけは、ある時に100万円の賞金に目がくらみ、ビクターの新人歌手発掘オーディションを受けたことでした。
ビクターのオーディションは…結果は残念ながらこちらも不合格に。
Coccoさんは当時のことをこのように回想してます。
「歌で行けるならバレエのオーディションで自分を落とした人間に『逃がした魚は大きかった』と思わせて見返してやろう」というもので、「ミリオンヒットをいくつか出して10億円貯めてとっとと辞めて沖縄に祖父みたいに劇場を作り、死ぬまで毎日踊り続けられたらいいな」
オーディションには受からなかったものの、彼女の類い稀なる才能に気づいたあるレコード会社の担当者が、Coccoさんの地元・沖縄までを探しにやってきて、歌手にならないかとスカウトしたのです。
スカウトされたCoccoさんですが、当初は「高校を卒業したら東京へ行ってバレリーナになる予定なので」と断っていたそう。
しかし、やがて「とっとと１０億円貯金して貯めて辞めてやる」と考え、歌手になることを容認したのです。
そして、1997年に「カウントダウン」で歌手デビューを果たしたのです。
Coccoさんの音楽は猟奇的で病的な歌詞に、オルタナティヴなサウンドが魅力で、一躍注目を集め、すぐに熱狂的なファンを産みました。
デビューした同年5月には早くも1stアルバム「ブーゲンビリア」をリリース。そして、翌1998年5月にリリースした2ndアルバウ「クムイウタ」が、オリコンウィークリーチャート初登場1位を記録し、80万枚以上の大ヒットを記録しました。
Coccoは結婚してた？旦那の存在。息子の父と死別の噂。 Coccoさんについて調べていくと「結婚」というキーワードが浮上してきます。
しかし、過去にCoccoさんが結婚したとの報道はありませんし、具体的な情報も一切出て来ませんでした。
これだけ情報がないとなると、Coccoさんが結婚しているという事実を完璧に隠しているかのどちらかだと思えるんですが。
昨今、Coccoさんの息子さんの存在が明らかになり、「お父さんは誰？」と話題になりました。
Coccoさんの息子の父親、つまり旦那か彼氏として噂されている人物像に関しては、ネット上で色々と噂があります。
その候補には、音楽関係者やボクサーなど、いくつか挙がっているようです。
噂の中には、Coccoさんの妊娠が発覚し、結婚する直前にその彼氏は病気や事故など何らかの理由により死別したという、憶測が進みすぎた話もありました。
息子のお父さんと死別の噂に関しては、どうやら過去にCoccoさんの楽曲には死をテーマにしたものが多いことから、そういう噂が浮上していたようです。
Coccoの息子のお父さんの噂・音楽関係者 Coccoさんの息子のお父さんですが、音楽関係者ではないか？との声もあります。
COCCOさん自身がシンガーソングライターとして活躍しているので、旦那も音楽関係者ではないか？と噂になるのは自然のことです。
過去にCoccoさんが活動休止になった際も、活動再開のきっかけもスタッフの説得だったということで、Coccoさんが信頼する身近な関係のスタッフの存在がいることは確かです。
Coccoの息子のお父さんの噂・プロボクサー Coccoさんの息子のお父さん候補の中には、プロボクサーもいます。
なぜ、そんな特殊な職業が噂になったかというと、Coccoさんの出身地の沖縄に秘密があります。
沖縄と言えば具志堅用高さんをはじめ、有名なボクサーが多いので、それが噂の発端となっているとか。
あまりにも信憑性の薄い理屈なので、可能性は低そうです・・・。
Coccoの息子のお父さんの噂・旦那とは死別？ 上記にも書きましたが、COCCOさんの旦那さんの噂で、旦那さんとは死別しているという噂もあります。
一時期のCOCCOさんの歌詞や音楽の雰囲気を見てると、その様な悲しい過去があっても納得してしまいますね。
そういう部分から予想され、死別したという噂が広まってしまっていますが、本当のところは謎です。
Coccoの息子・「Koto（こうと）」の年齢。現在はファッションブランド？ 結果的にCOCCOさんには明らかにされている旦那がいないのですが、なんとCOCCOさんには息子がいます。
Coccoさんの息子の名前は「Koto（こうと）」君です。
本名かどうかはわかりませんが、Coccoさんは息子さんのことをそう呼んでいます。
年齢は2022年6月現在、23歳になっている計算ですね。
前述したようにCoccoさんには恐らく結婚歴はありません。</description></item><item><title>Joseph Hunsginer Obituary: Tragic Accident Claims the Life of Joseph Hunsginer Near Toledo Zoo</title><link>/joseph-hunsginer-obituary-tragic-accident-claims-the-life-of-joseph-hunsginer-near-toledo-zoo.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/joseph-hunsginer-obituary-tragic-accident-claims-the-life-of-joseph-hunsginer-near-toledo-zoo.html</guid><description>Joseph Hunsginer Obituary: Tragic Accident Claims the Life of Joseph Hunsginer Near Toledo Zoo.

1992年に26歳の若さで亡くなってしまいましたが、彼は既婚者で子供がいました。
生前、同じく歌手の斉藤由貴さんとの不倫関係が有名でした。
女性に纏わる噂も多かったことから、過去には他にも子供がいるのではないか？という諸説が存在しました。
死後30年以上経っているのに公な子供は妻・繁美さんとの間に生まれた息子・裕哉（ひろや）さんだけです。
女性関係で色々あっただけに、もしかした明らかになっていない隠し子がいるのではないか？という疑惑があります。
また、嫁・繁美さんとの間に生まれた息子の裕哉さんの現在の歌手活動なども追ってみてみたいです。
尾崎豊の息子・裕哉（ひろや）。1989年生まれでアメリカ育ちで英語堪能
名前 尾崎 裕哉（おざき ひろや） 生年月日 1989年7月24日 出身地 東京都 血液型 O型 父親 尾崎豊 母親 尾崎繁美 学歴 慶応義塾大学
職業 シンガーソングライター 尾崎豊さんは1988年に、一般人の女性・繁美（しげみ）さんと結婚しました。
そして、結婚した1年後の1989年の７月２４日に、第一子の長男の「裕哉（ひろや）」が誕生してます。
尾崎豊さんは1992年に亡くなってしまったのですが、その間に第二子の子供が生まれることはありませんでした。
つまり、尾崎豊さんと妻・繁美さんとの間に生まれた子供は、息子の裕哉さんただ一人で間違いありません。
裕哉さんは1994年に母の繁美さんと共にアメリカに渡ります。
なぜ妻・繁美と息子・裕哉は渡米したのか？陰謀説に恐怖 なぜ、母子でアメリカに渡ったかというと、1994年に尾崎豊さんの死の真相について不可解な点があり、母の繁美さんによる陰謀ではないか？という説が出たからです。
ある記者は、尾崎豊さんの死の真実は、妻・繁美さんとの軋轢にあると憶測を立てていました。
その説を信じる熱狂的なファンが、繁美さんに対して嫌がらせを始め、それに恐怖を感じた繁美さんは裕哉さんを連れて海外に脱出したということです。
その後に、妻・繁美さんはその説を記事にした記者を裁判で訴え、見事に勝訴してます。
遺書の存在は息子・裕哉への影響を考えて長年非公開 2011年に尾崎豊さんが生前に書いたとされる遺書が公開されました。
遺書を公開したのは1994年から妻・繁美さんを直接取材し続けていたジャーナリストです。
遺書の内容には、尾崎豊さんがずっと死を意識していたことが綴られております。
当時まで3歳だった息子への影響を考え、遺書の存在を長年伝えていませんでした。
2011年に、裕哉さんが２２歳まで公開しなかったのは、ジャーナリストが妻・繁美さんとの約束を守ったということです。
息子・尾崎裕哉の現在は歌手。父・豊と顔と声が似てる？
東京に生まれた尾崎豊さんの息子・裕哉さんですが、3歳の頃に母・繁美さんと共にアメリカのボストンに渡ります。
渡米したばかりの頃は英語がろくに話せず、いじめれることもあったそうです。つまりはインターナショナルスクールではなく普通の学校に通っていたかと思われます。
その後に15歳で帰国してます。長年アメリカにいた経験から、ネイティブな英語の発音を取得しています。
尾崎裕哉は高校卒業後に「慶應義塾大学」の環境情報学部に進学しました。
卒業後は慶應義塾大学大学院に進学し、2015年に大学院の過程も修了しています。
裕哉さんは小学6年生の頃から父親・尾崎豊の楽曲を聴くようになったそうです。</description></item><item><title>AnneKee Molenaar Matthijs de Ligt, Body, Profession &amp;amp; Net Worth</title><link>/annekee-molenaar-matthijs-de-ligt-body-profession-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/annekee-molenaar-matthijs-de-ligt-body-profession-net-worth.html</guid><description>The Dutch model and social media star AnneKee Molenaar is widely known for being the lady-love of Dutch-footballer Matthijs de Ligt.
