She <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> to boyfriend&nbsp;<strong>Luis “Louie” Ruelas </strong>on&nbsp;October 19 at the&nbsp;Amanzoe Resort in Porto Heli, Greece.

On the very same day, the Bravo star shared a photo of herself with Luis at a football field, writing, “Excited to reveal my new boyfriend” and added a heart emoji!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>So, who exactly is the new man who was able to capture Teresa’s eye after she and <strong>Joe Giudice</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ended their 20-year marriage</a> in Dec. 2019? We’ve got all you need to know about Luis.</p><h2><strong><strong>1. Luis co-founded Digital Media Solutions.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The New Jersey-based businessman is also the executive vice president of business development at the digital marketing solutions company, which “offers acquisition solutions, subscription marketing, lead management technology, and managed services,” according to its profile on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bloomberg</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Luis Ruelas is pictured on the right at a charity event. (Photo Courtesy of Facebook)</p><h2><strong><strong>2. Teresa’s new man is an active philanthropist.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Luis’ charitable activities are widely documented across the Internet! Through his company Digital Media Solutions, Luis fed over 300 families in Harlem, NY in May of 2020, according to a post from the non-profit organization JL Blessings that works to aid homeless individuals in New Jersey.</p><h2><strong><strong>3. He’s a father of two.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>One of his children is Autistic, and so Luis “spends a great deal of time advocating for children with special needs with a particular focus on Autism given his son’s condition,” according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>company bio</a>. This means Luis shares something in common with Teresa, since she too is a parent! The Bravo star shares four daughters — &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gia</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gabriella</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Milania</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Audriana </strong></a>—&nbsp;with her ex-husband Joe.</p><h2><strong><strong>4. Luis started dating Teresa in 2020.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>The relationship between&nbsp;<span class=mark82qgiqjni data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Teresa</span> and Luis is very new. She’s very happy and they’re still getting to know each other. She’s been ready to move on for a really long time now and is taking it slow but seems to really like him,” a source close to the Giudice family EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>in November 2020.</p><h2><strong><strong>5. Luis is Teresa’s first reported boyfriend since her divorce.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Meanwhile, Joe revealed that he is also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“seeing” someone new</a>: a lawyer who, like Teresa’s ex, is also based in Italy. Joe has been living in the European country since Oct. 2019, after being ordered to be deported to the country he was born in once he wrapped up his prison sentence for fraud charges in the U.S.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K5trXSZqmunZyWwG6u1Kygp52jqLqiuoxtaW5sZWyEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
