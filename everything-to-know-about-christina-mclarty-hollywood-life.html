She currently works as an actor, director, and producer, seeing her career take off after her memorable role as Monica Geller on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC sitcom&nbsp;Friends</a>, which aired from 1994 to 2004.

In 2004, the pair gave birth to a daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Coco Arquette</strong>, who is now 17. On October 11, 2010, David and Courteney announced their separation, although they still maintained a close friendship and business partnership with Coquette Productions. Then, in June 2012, David officially filed for divorce from Courteney and the divorce was finalized in May 2013. “I just had a moment of looking at our relationship, and there wasn’t anything in particular, but it brought up a lot of stuff,” Courteney told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2011. “Maybe on second thought, don’t reevaluate. Just keep going. Don’t rock the boat. Repression is fantastic.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Although they’ve been separated for years and have both moved on to new relationships, they reunited for the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>latest installment in the&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;franchise</a> reprising their original roles as Dewey and Gale. When speaking of working on the horror flick with his ex-wife, David told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Times</a>, “It’s a cathartic experience to just be able to act opposite Courteney,” he said in the Jan. 5 interview. “It’s been 25 years of our lives. We’ve grown up together. We have a child together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OaraKcXZa%2FssHEraueZaees6Z5k29ob21laHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
