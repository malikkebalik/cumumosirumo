Less than three percent of Asians and less than one percent of LGBTQ people are represented in TV and film, so I think it's great that "Grey's Anatomy" combined both of these demographics into one role. It's truly an honor, and I just hope I'm doing a good job.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>I want to do the best job I can…</h2><p>When the show aired Landi's first on-screen kiss&nbsp;with his gay co-star, Jake Borelli, who came out about his sexuality back in 2018, fans questioned Landi's sexuality.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, in an interview with Hype, the grey's anatomy star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned</a>&nbsp;that he is merely an actor dedicated to doing his best job for any role, regardless of his sexuality or the character's.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Further along in the interview, the actor added that casting decisions should be about who can portray the role perfectly rather than a question of ethnicity or sexuality. He further adds that no role should be pre-defined by unchangeable factors like; ethnicity and sexual orientation, as this leads to not everyone having equal opportunities. Landi&nbsp;said;&nbsp;</p><p>"It comes down to the role breakdown, it just falls into whoever can do it the best and what the producer likes... There are discussions about transgender actors playing transgender roles...and Asian actors speaking up about whitewashing simply because not all actors have equal opportunities... When roles stop being pre-defined by ethnicity and sexual orientation, that is when these discussions will no longer be at the forefront of casting decisions."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a5psSMpZinnJlisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYsC1sdGepq2xoJrAb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
