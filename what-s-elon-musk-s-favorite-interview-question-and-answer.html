When you appear for an interview with Musk, you can expect him to ask you to describe the most difficult problems you have ever worked on and how you solved them. Musk uses this question to catch a liar. He believes that someone who really solved a problem would know how they did it and describe it in detail. The question also helps him identify people with exceptional abilities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Musk is fond of giving a tricky riddle to candidates interviewing for jobs. In the riddle, he asks where you would be if you standing on the surface of the Earth and moved one mile south, one mile west, and another mile north. Musk’s riddle has two possible answers: North Pole and South Pole. But he doesn’t seek a correct answer. Instead, he tries to identify critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rawlinson didn’t design Model S.
