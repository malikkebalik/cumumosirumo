He is known for his role as <i>Anwar Bakshi </i>in the super-popular Netflix series <i>Sex Education</i>. His character is best friends with Mimi Keene's character, <i>Ruby Mathews</i>, in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The popular Netflix show has amassed a huge fan following, with the <i>Sex Education's</i> success being one of the reasons Netflix increased its UK production to $1 billion some time back. The show's season three gained over 55 Million viewers.</p><h2>Relationship Status: Kular Is Single</h2><p>Chaneil Kular is still looking to discover the love of his life, as the <i>Sex Education</i> actor is currently single. It hasn't been long since he started working as an actor, so he is focused on making his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/26/Screenshot_20230126_141248%20(1)%20(1)-1674721739445.jpg><p>Kular is also a private man, and the records of his previous relationships (if any) are nonexistent. He is also a straight man, unlike <i>Anwar Bakshi's</i> character who plays in <i>Sex Education</i>. When he isn't working, he loves spending time with his friends. For now, the actor is single.</p><h2>What Is Chaneil Kular's Net Worth?</h2><p><i>Sex Education</i> actor Chaneil Kular has an estimated net worth of <strong>$100,000 </strong>similar earnings as<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Anna McClung</strong></a>. It might not look much for an actor but bear in mind that he only started getting roles in the industry not too long ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The most commercially successful project he has been involved with is Netflix's <i>Sex Education</i>, whose season 3 saw a viewership of more than <strong>55 Million</strong>. The money he gets paid per episode of the show remains to be known, but, considering he is an important character, it's safe to assume he must have been paid well.</p><h2>Body Measurements</h2><p><i>Sex Education's</i> Chaneil is well-built and keeps himself in good shape. He has a chest size of <strong>39 inches </strong>(99 cm) and a waist of <strong>29 inches</strong>(74 cm). His biceps measure<strong> 10 inches </strong>(25 cm).

His parents are Indian, and it is known that they were living in the UK when Kular was born. But, it is yet to be known if they were born in the UK or had migrated to the land.</p><p>Kular father and mother live a private life, away from their son's fame. Their whereabouts and what they do for a living are not known yet.

In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>DMY BY DMY</i></a>, he said that his time at the University didn't last long, but he made some good friends and memories.</p><p>Kular is a Brummie, so it's no surprise he studied in Birmingham.

It is one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, founded in 1552 by King Edward VI.</p><h2>Kular's Role In Sex Education</h2><p>Chaneil Kular plays the role of <i>Anwar Bakshi</i> in Sex Education and is one of the main characters in the show. The character of <i>Bakshi</i> is not liked by many, as the viewers find him very rude toward others. It shows Kular's acting prowess as he has convinced the viewers of the character he portrays.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>But the role wasn't just given to Kular as he earned it. He had to go through the audition process and get the part. He has been involved with the show since season 1. Some of the highlights of his character in the show are his romance with <i>Nick</i> and friendship with <i>Ruby</i>, played by <a href=#>Mimi Keene</a>.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Kular is on the internet, and you can find him on Instagram and Twitter. His Insta page and Twitter handle are <a href=# rel=nofollow>@chaneilkular</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Chaneil_Kular</a>, respectively.
