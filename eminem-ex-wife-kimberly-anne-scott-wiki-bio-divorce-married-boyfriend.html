Knowing that the beautiful classmate was homeless, Eminem brought her to his home and convinced his mother to keep her at theirs. When the mother didn’t agree later, they left Eminem’s home to live in a rented apartment. Eminem left school in the 9th grade and started working.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/images-1-207x300.jpg><p>Thus the Mathers couple started living together since then. Although they lived together and continued dating, their relationship was covered with hardship with no guardians in their support. Kimberly Anne Scott lived like an orphan while Eminem’s mother never supported their living together.</p><p>Their tolerance level had to go through tests even harder this time when Kimberly got pregnant in 1995 and gave birth to their baby <strong>Hailie</strong> on the Christmas day that year (1995). After the baby girl’s birth, Eminem’s life got even harder as he had to work overtime with a low pay of $5.5 an hour. Hailie’s birth led to a kind of married life which remained until their first divorce.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Eminem_Ex-wife%E2%80%99s_Relationship_with_Her_Husband></span>Eminem Ex-wife’s Relationship with Her Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kimberly married Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III) in 1999 and after four years the first child,&nbsp;<strong>Hailie&nbsp;Jade</strong> was born in&nbsp;1995. The baby was born without any concrete plan.</p><p>The birth of the baby created such circumstances that they decided to marry. However, their relationships didn’t go as they assumed. Eminem wanted to continue with his music career, but, he already had a baby and a nursing mother as his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/z-300x188.jpg><p>Perhaps due to his unfulfilled desire for career building, the couple frequently remained in a stressful married life with the immense pressure of supporting the family. But, the frequent union and separation also had effects on their relationship. Kimberly Anne Scott’s turbulent childhood, Eminem’s mother’s rudeness must have made them be more practical and settle their disputes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mathers_Divorce_with_Eminem_and_Parenting_Their_Children></span>Kim Mathers Divorce with Eminem and Parenting Their Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Given Their Troubled Childhood and Unexpected Marriage, their married life couldn’t continue. Eminem started humiliating his wife Kim Mathers publicly even through his songs. Eminem’s rap number 97 Bonnie and Clyde&nbsp;played a story on screen murdering Kim which surprisingly became Eminem’s fans favorite.</p><p>Kim got psychologically insane, attempted suicide, and irritated Eminem by kissing his acquaintance <strong>John Guerra</strong>. Finally, Eminem appealed for divorce, and the couple eventually separated in 2001.</p><p>Kim Mathers dated another man and gave birth to his daughter before she again married Eminem in 2006 which lasted only for 41 days this time, and they finally separated.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mathers_Was_One_of_the_Abandoned_Children_Parents%E2%80%99_Troubled_Married_Life_and_Meeting_Eminem></span>Kim Mathers Was One of the Abandoned Children: Parents’ Troubled Married Life and Meeting Eminem<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kimberly Anne Scott’s troubled family situation must have somehow affected the way she has her attitude on anything, on her married life or husband also.

Her mother took to another husband, and this stepfather allegedly abused them. Unable to bear the maltreatment, the 13-year-old Kimberly Anne Scott ran away with her twin sister. They took shelter in a youth home in 1998. Later from there, Eminem’s mother <strong>Debbie Nelson</strong> had them and kept them with her.</p><p>This troubled history and lack of a father’s love must have a lasting psychological effect on Kimberly Anne Scott’s Electra complex which she soon reconciled in a male boyfriend, Eminem.</p><p>Eminem used to be together with Kimberly Anne Scott almost all the time, at home, on the way to school, at school, and in several family occasions. They couldn’t resist one another’s love and the on and off again love affair started.</p><h3>Eminem’ Ex-Wife Kim Mathers’ Children</h3><p>Kimberly Anne Scott has given birth to two children: one from Eminem and one from <strong>Eric Harter</strong>.
