They both died tragically not too far apart from one another. I flipped through more pictures of my youth only to come across at least 6 other friends who had been taken from this world…violently. I can’t even count acquaintances. There was a time all that loss felt like the norm; today it felt unnatural, strange, downright wrong. Half of my life was surviving a war zone…genocide. I’m grateful for what I have survived. GratefuI that I can spend an evening with Fallon playing a pie in the face game. Grateful I didn’t become a statistic like I often thought I would. Grateful that my own children don’t have to confront the loss and violence in their neighborhood in the way their parents had to. But, I also feel helpless, a bit depressed that there are so many of us who still do. And it feels like it’s only gotten and getting worse.”</p><p>Although there have been rumors of a romantic relationship between Smith and Shakur, she has previously stated that the two were solely friends.</p><p>Tupac passed away on September 13, 1996, days after he was shot multiple times in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong><a href=#>Will And Jada Try To Stop The Violence</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZjZn11fI6toK2klWO3orDAZqeippuawbV50qagraBdlrGlvsSsqp6rXZmyosDHZqafZaSqvaKvjK%2BgqKSVo7CmecinZKiolaN6rbHTrZyr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
