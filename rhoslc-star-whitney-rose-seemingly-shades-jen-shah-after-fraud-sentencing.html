SHAH previously pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with telemarketing.” The mom-of-two plead guilty on July 11, 2022, following her March 30, 2021 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrest</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>U.S. Attorney <strong>Damian Williams</strong> noted in the press release that Jen now “faces the consequences” of her actions. “With today’s sentence, Jennifer Shah finally faces the consequences of the many years she spent targeting vulnerable, elderly victims,” the statement began. “These individuals were lured in by false promises of financial security, but in reality, Shah and her co-conspirators defrauded them out of their savings and left them with nothing to show for it. This conviction and sentence demonstrate once again that we will continue to vigorously protect victims of financial fraud and hold accountable those who engage in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fraudulent schemes</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye49vZqugn6i5pHnWoaCtppWuerO70p5krKCRmbJutsSnZKygkZ16p77Arptmq5Wjwaa6wqKloGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
