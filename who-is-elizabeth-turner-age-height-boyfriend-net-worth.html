She also said that if she wasn’t a model, she would be studying for a PhD in Psychology, as she is totally in love with the subject, and helping people.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><h3><span id=Modelling_career_first_steps>Modelling career: first steps</span></h3><p>Elizabeth started her modelling career while she was a senior in her high school, being featured in the pages of Teen Vogue back in 2010, and signed her first contract with Factor Women Model Management, located in Atlanta, Georgia.

She’s gained a massive following of her social media account, heading to a million milestone as of April 2020. She mostly posts her photos from various photoshoots, but sometimes shares something personal.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.org///marriedbiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/elizabeth-turner-sunset-seperates-lookbook-2020-13-652x1024.jpg></p><p>Her fame on social media has gained Elizabeth commercial contracts with such brands as AmEx and Frankie’s Bikinis.</p><h2><span id=Controversy_with_SnapChat>Controversy with SnapChat</span></h2><p>In July 2011 Elizabeth along with her elder sister Sarah modeled for a promotional campaign of the SnapChat application, also shooting for Picaboo initial application for iPhone. However, later the sisters discovered that their photos were used in further campaigns, so in September 2014, they both filed a lawsuit against SnapChat and Picaboo, accusing them of reputation damage and misusing the photos. Elizabeth also <a rel=nofollow href=#>claimed</a> that she worked for free with the SnapChat co-founder named Evan Spiegel, who convinced her to actually donate her photos for the project, and promised her not to use them anywhere else.</p><p>Sarah Turner also joined the shoot, meeting with Evan Spiegel and his colleague Bobby Murphy at Spiegel’s residence in Toyopa Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. Elizabeth and Sarah later emphasized that their pictures were made only for an iPhone application version, while in fact they were used for the Android version of the app, as well as on the website of the application. Sarah and Elizabeth claimed that it was their photos which also helped the founders of SnapChat to reach the current valuation of the app, which at that moment was around $10 billion. The lawsuit was settled, but with no information on the payment made to the Turner sisters revealed.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life_Did_Elizabeth_date_Leonardo_DiCaprio>Personal life.
