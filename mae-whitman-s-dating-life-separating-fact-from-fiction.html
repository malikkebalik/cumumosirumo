She likes everyone around, and there is remarkable potential in everyone she meets!&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Want to know more about her dating life? We've got you covered! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Has Mae Whitman dated?</h2><p>According to sources, Whitman was in a relationship with a 34-year old Canadian actor, Dov Tiefrnbach, since 2008. They maintained a low-key dating life. But the couple broke up later, without citing any explanation to the fans.</p><p>As per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a>&nbsp;of Heavy, Whitman was also dating Landon Pigg, a noted singer and songwriter. She even helped him compose songs. The alleged couple had also appeared in some episodes of&nbsp;Parenthood.&nbsp;They shared a relationship during the shooting of this family drama.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2014, Mae revealed that they maintained a friendly equation post their breakup and referred to Landon as her favorite guest star. In her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with Glamour, she also refrained from commenting anything about her present love life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Nevertheless, it was also rumored that&nbsp;The DUFF-star was dating Haley Joel Osment in 2002.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Busting Rumors About Her Private Life</h2><p>Many rumors are brewing up about the&nbsp;Good Girls&nbsp;star Whitman. She is very discreet about her private life, and she has never opened up much about whom she dates in social media or public forums.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the&nbsp;Wonder Girl&nbsp;has confessed that she has an attraction for both men and women though she has never dated anyone of the same sex. To put it in another way, at least she has never been public about dating any girl. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since her relationship with Pigg failed, she became more secretive and discreet about her dating life and relationships. In 2014, many people speculated that she was dating Peter Krause.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They were spotted together frequently, and as per the reports, the two shared beautiful chemistry. But they never made an appearance as a couple. Whitman refers to him as her BFF and uses an adorable pet name, 'little one,' to refer to him.</p><h2>Whitman's Flourishing Career</h2><p>Born on 9th June 1988, the actor has bagged more than 150 acting credits with roles in television, film work, and also as a voice-over artist. Her first notable voice work was in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Avatar</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;Katara.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for the big screen, she has delivered spellbinding performances in&nbsp;The DUFF, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.&nbsp;From a supporting turn in&nbsp;Arrested Development&nbsp;to&nbsp;Good Girls' lead role, Whitman has come a long way to be in the spotlight.
