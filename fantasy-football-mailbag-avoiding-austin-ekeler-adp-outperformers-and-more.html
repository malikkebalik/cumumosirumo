Thanks for sending them. Here are the ones that I thought were most generally actionable and relatable given that camps have yet to start.&nbsp;They’re also the ones I’m able to answer.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Which player who is frequently taken in the first round will be a bust? — Ryan D.</strong></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p dir=ltr>First, consider the historical analysis of the first round I did for The Athletic fantasy magazine last year. The average is an 11.6% decline in prior-year points. So if you do only that bad, you’re fine. I guess a bust would be about a 30% drop in points, either due to injury (most likely) or just bad performance. I also don’t like, “I could have taken a better player later,” as we can say that about just about every player taken in the first round. You have to calibrate your expectations. We obviously can’t project injuries, except that running backs are about twice as likely to miss multiple games as wide receivers. So if you want to cut that risk in half, draft a WR.</p><p dir=ltr>Ignoring injuries and just looking at expected performance, the guy I just will not take is <a href=#><strong>Austin Ekeler</strong></a>. He’s aging out of peak production. Passes to RBs are the worst play in football (by any success-rate methodology) and the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=56 href=#>Chargers</a> want to de-emphasize that, as we can see by how they switched OCs/systems. Goodbye 127 targets. Ekeler is not a between-the-tackle runner, yet has had incredible TD efficiency, which seems likely to regress. Ekeler scored 372 PPR points. So I’m saying he’s going to get about 260, if he stays healthy. I will admit a lot of this regression is priced in but, as they say, never try to catch a falling knife.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>What metrics are your favorite for evaluating and finding values at each position group (QB, RB, WR, TE)? — Jonathan H.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>For RBs and WRs, it’s market share, which I write about here every week on Tuesdays during the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a> regular season. While targets are more important for a RB than carries, carries are more predictive of future touches than targets are. So that’s tricky. I care about air yards for WRs at the extremes — I don’t want too few per attempt nor too many. It’s like Goldilocks. The porridge has to be just right. The sweet spot is 9-to-11 air yards per target, and 10 is actually ideal.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p dir=ltr>TEs is simple: Is he on the field on 3rd-and-long and running routes? If yes, I want him. If not, he’s just a rando. My time-honored method for picking QBs is YPA. I want his rank in efficiency to comport with the TD% ranking, for predictive purposes. That’s how I’ll always bet. By this method, with 2023 starters (not including <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XUAZZ3AjcOywkoZU href=#>Ryan Tannehill</a> given TEN using a premium pick on a QB), the buy is <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=9TQu1PJeoFlq725G href=#>Tua Tagovailoa</a></strong>, for sure. Maybe <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=yhzPJprUoEnfzPvf href=#>Jalen Hurts</a></strong>, but he takes away a lot of his passing TDs with his own running TDs (he has a cushion here though). If <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=3Nxpcb3Oda9xKjNY href=#>Sam Darnold</a></strong> starts, he’d be a buy given his YPA was second only to Tua. The fades (TD% was too high relative to YPA) would be <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0ItM9ROZC8mOtKOv href=#>Brock Purdy</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8vrQt8GE4bS4X4Xa href=#>Lamar Jackson</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1NrLfCowWevnKYEe href=#>Dak Prescott</a>. Of course, Jackson runs, and he runs proactively and predictably, though injury risk comes with it (also the risk of almost any injury severely hampering his running).</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Which players, based on their current ADPs, do you think are most likely to outperform their draft position? — Robert B.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Let’s limit this to guys going outside the Top 100 overall picks currently. I like <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=zRWbKdclapogMzcq href=#>David Njoku</a></strong> at pick No. 108 on average. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=jcxErAcw3SOmBLdo href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a></strong> at pick No. 115 — I think he throws 35 TDs again, his three-year average. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=eGiVBnU1v4yPJ8oV href=#>Allen Lazard</a></strong>, just because of Rodgers, at pick No. 123 as sort of a poor man’s <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TbtHrFRp7Lrr9gRR href=#>Tee Higgins</a>. I hate RBs with Achilles histories but <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=z8djv1zj7ZnuvLed href=#>D’Onta Foreman</a></strong> was very good last year and got some money, so 137th is cheap. <strong>Jeff Wilson</strong> is too good and the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=47 href=#>Dolphins</a> have too good a run system for him to be pick No. 153. I like buying a <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=0AHLTh95vm3CvtV9 href=#>Michael Gallup</a></strong> bounce-back two years after his ACL injury at pick No. 162. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=WxGK94PTTtMRKtUL href=#>Jonathan Mingo</a></strong> could be a <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MVKA2Tjc5jrKX2Eo href=#>Garrett Wilson</a>-type but with better QB play (actually having his stats boosted with better QB play than rookie Wilson), at pick 176.</p><p><strong>How do I win my league but make it look like I didn’t try super hard? — Peter H.</strong></p><p dir=ltr><strong>@Peter H. Do you have a flux capacitor? What I would do is travel several months into the future and pull up a website with 2023 NFL fantasy leaders. I think the rest is self-explanatory. — Wes B.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>I think the key to drafting in the second and third rounds is asking, “Who could be the coverboy of fantasy football magazines next year?” <strong>Garrett Wilson</strong>. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=NW1Jv9Ej3oDBk3yr href=#>Nick Chubb</a></strong>. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=v0cZTIrAKEC0JWM8 href=#>Tony Pollard</a></strong>. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=JEtNWBI0qsAxAQQJ href=#>Rhamondre Stevenson</a></strong>. Those guys scare me a little as an opponent.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Who do you see as an overrated WR? I think <a class=ath_autolink data-id=FBJF4NEJQGDVUpnC href=#>Davante Adams</a> scares me with Jimmy G? Am I overthinking it? — Varman N.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>I think you are. Why are we killing Adams for QB play/injury risk but ignoring it completely with the Dolphins WRs and with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=GVPoK13XWqyWuFir href=#>Cooper Kupp</a>? <a class=ath_autolink data-id=linudLDO0YoIWthi href=#>Derek Carr</a> was benched, which is like an injury. Yet Adams was great all year, leading WRs in TDs. Is Jimmy Garappolo even a step down from Carr? More targets probably left town than came in, at least expected targets, with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=UtIo2JIONtuLNq5x href=#>Darren Waller</a> gone. I see Adams with 180 targets again, assuming he’s healthy. I don’t take him as the No. 3 WR because I don’t have to, but if he went there, I would. I just don’t get the fear here where it’s totally absent with Kupp, especially.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>What are your thoughts on the LA Chargers this year starting the season with all their receivers healthy and with Kellen Moore as OC? Who offers more value, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XGV9gVOFefUVWSHi href=#>Keenan Allen</a> or <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ML1CWh5B5qxLiF5o href=#>Mike Williams</a>? — Juansi A.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Well, Allen goes two rounds earlier. I want little to do with him (he’s allergic to the end zone) and nothing to do with Williams. I guess I’m drafting <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TQyVCCH7JvMDHcDN href=#>Quentin Johnston</a> if he makes it to the triple digit picks (right now he’s No. 99). I can see taking Keenan Allen if he falls well into the fourth round, and ideally the fifth.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Can you help me learn from last year’s mistakes? In my 2022 home league draft I was banking on <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ywZaiAVoxbDIL63z href=#>JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> and Allen Robinson… What can I learn from missing on both? — Peter S.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>I love your process here. I tell people an expert is just someone who’s made every mistake that can be made in a very narrow field. That’s me in fantasy football. Hopefully, I’ve learned from it. The lesson here is that when a wide receiver goes bad, don’t pay for him to bounce back. Robinson was the horrible pick. JuJu wasn’t even that bad. The lesson with JuJu is also one of not expecting a player whose only success came with a great running mate (<a class=ath_autolink data-id=dFkigZYfylHbH2Ra href=#>Antonio Brown</a>) and Hall of Fame QB to be able to step up into a true WR1 role. Plus, JuJu didn’t even get security or money last year from the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=46 href=#>Chiefs</a>. So really no one in the league believed in him, so why should we have believed?</p><p dir=ltr><strong>How should one consider a player’s ceiling, floor, and median outcome when drafting? Everyone wants to find the “league winners” but how do you maintain a balance? — Ayush M.</strong></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p dir=ltr>Fantasy football is so different from fantasy baseball. You want about five top scorers to win. QBs who score well can come from all areas of the draft, so that’s why we wait there. WRs are way more likely to be top scorers than RBs after Round 1, so that’s why we focus on them in the “RB dead zone.” If you get <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4wuXOfkjv6uJbT7O href=#>Travis Kelce</a>, you’ve landed a top player where, at most, one or two league mates will convert that TE slot into an actual asset. You have to expect about half of your top picks to fall short though. So that’s why you really have to focus on the player’s ceiling rather than his floor after the seventh round. With every pick, ask, “Is there a plausible path for this player to be a guy I happily start every week.” Just plausible. No guarantees. But some players we draft are almost certain to be replacement level, guys we can just replace easily on waivers. Why draft <a class=ath_autolink data-id=W0zSpzqMtojpbArU href=#>Tyler Boyd</a> for example? Why draft JuJu? <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WnLx6ILnpqUFSWlV href=#>Jakobi Meyers</a>? <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9Ps1MFRXoDMzHOvl href=#>Devin Singletary</a>? <a class=ath_autolink data-id=wp50rfC8lPuVYJSf href=#>Adam Thielen</a>? <a class=ath_autolink data-id=FE6Y1HgdRshAoBXt href=#>Dawson Knox</a>? I could go on. You get the idea.
