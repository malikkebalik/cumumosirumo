He is a quite large frame and broad shoulders. John Cena is a former WWE wrestler who is now an actor. We shall discuss more about him in the following paragraphs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=WWE_John_Cena_Height_How_tall_is_the_former_wrestling_champion></span>WWE John Cena Height: How tall is the former wrestling champion?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Cena is 6ft tall and he weighs 114kg. He is a former American Professional Wrestling superstar. He is now an actor. He has acted in movies like The Marine, 12 Rounds, The Suicide Squad among others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Other_Wrestlers_like_John_Cena_Height></span>Other Wrestlers like John Cena Height <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Edge_Height_6ft_5_inch></span>Edge Height (6ft 5 inch)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>WWE Superstar Edge is one of the tallest wrestlers in the company. However, when compared to others, Rated-R-height Superstar’s was frequently underrated.</p><p>He’s faced some of the most famous wrestlers, from The Undertaker to John Cena, and the fact that he works with someone smaller than him shows how tall he is. Edge, on the other hand, has been a standout performer for WWE over the years, causing people to overlook his stature.</p><p>Drew McIntyre Height (6 Feet 5 Inches)</p><p>John Cena height is nothing compared to that of Drew McIntyre even though they are both 6ft tall. He is also a pro wrestler in the WWE. Drew McIntyre had a great start to 2021, as he began the year as WWE Champion for the second time. The Scottish Psychopath was prominent in the main event scene for the first half of the year before taking a back seat in major storylines in the second half.</p><p>McIntyre is a physical specimen, standing 6 ft 5 in. tall. His height hasn’t hindered him in any way, and he’s one of the best in-ring workers on the roster. However, it’s only a matter of time before McIntyre is back in world championship contention, and perhaps a third world championship reign is on the horizon.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cesare_Height_6ft_and_5_inches></span>Cesare Height (6ft and 5 inches) <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>Also, John Cena height is below that of Cesare.</p><p>Cesaro is a talented and well-respected in-ring competitor on the WWE roster. The Swiss Superman finally had his first WrestleMania singles match, defeating Seth Rollins in a pure wrestling match at WrestleMania 37. Another aspect of Cesaro’s appearance that is often overlooked is his height of 6ft 5in.</p><p>Cesaro’s raw power is impressive, and he is athletic. Cesaro is one of the best wrestlers to never win a WWE World Championship, and he came close to winning the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns at WrestleMania Backlash. Cesaro’s height hasn’t held him back, but he has used it to his advantage.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Triple_H_Height_6ft_and_2_inches></span>Triple H Height (6ft and 2 inches)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h5><p>Triple H height is ssimilar to John Cena height. The veteran wrestler who was once a general manager in the WWE is 6ft and 2 inches tall. Triple H is currently the Chief Content Officer of the WWE. He is also an actor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Peers Kurt Angle and John “Bradshaw” Layfield, as well as veteran industry personality Paul Heyman, have named Cena the greatest professional wrestler of all time.</p><p>Cena enrolled in Rick Bassman’s Ultimate Pro-Wrestling (UPW) academy in California in 1999. In April 2000, he was the UPW Heavyweight Champion.

Cena was assigned to the WWF’s Ohio Valley Wrestling division. Cena tried out for the main WWF roster four times in 2001.</p><p>This pattern continued into 2002.

Cena went on to become the face of WWE for the next ten years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_Cena_Movies></span>John Cena Movies <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Almost immediately after signing with WWE, John began pursuing an acting career. He made an appearance in the film “Ready to Rumble” in 2000. He starred in the 2006 film “The Marine,” which grossed $30 million on a $15 million budget. Over the next decade, he continued to appear in films.</p><p>By 2018, he had established himself as a box office success. Other notable films include “Trainwreck” in 2015, “Daddy’s Home 2” in 2017, “Blockers” in 2018, and “Playing with Fire” in 2019. In 2020, he played the polar bear Yoshi in the film “Dolittle.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship></span>Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From 2009 to 2012, John was wedded to Elizabeth Huberdeau. Later that year, he began dating WWE superstar Nikki Bella. In 2017, he proposed to Nikki at WrestleMania 33. Sadly, their romance ended a year later, a month before their wedding.</p><p>Cena has stated on numerous occasions that he does not want to have children because he does not want to be an absentee parent while pursuing his career, and he has had a vasectomy.</p><p>John Cena enjoys collecting rare and custom-made automobiles. He owns over 20 cars, including a vintage Oldsmobile Cutlass Rallye 350 and a 2006 Rolls Royce Phantom.</p><p>Cena has granted the most wishes in Make-A-Wish Foundation history, with over 500 granted to children with life-threatening illnesses.</p><p>Cena wore a black “Rise Above Hate” T-shirt promoting WWE’s “Be a Star” anti-bullying campaign from late 2011 until WrestleMania XXVIII. Cena wore pink and black with the phrase “Rise Above Cancer” in September and October 2012 as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in collaboration with Susan G. Komen for the Cure.</p><p>Cena appeared in “We Are America,” a public service announcement sponsored by the Ad Council as part of its “Love Has No Labels” campaign, in November 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_Cena_Net_Worth></span>John Cena Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Cena has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $80 million as an American professional wrestler, bodybuilder, rapper, and actor. John Cena rose to prominence as a WWE professional wrestler. He has since evolved into an A-list actor and television host. He is also the current host of Nickelodeon’s Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader? and has appeared in a number of films and television series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_Cena_House_Where_does_he_live></span>John Cena House: Where does he live?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John lives in Nature’s Reserve, a private, gated community in Land O’ Lakes, Florida, about 20 miles north of Tampa. In January 2005, he paid $525,000 for the 3,704-square-foot house. Since he bought it, the house has undergone several renovations.</p><p>Cena also owns a home in San Diego’s Mission Hills neighborhood. The colonial-style home has a swimming pool with an infinity edge, a hot tub, a full outdoor kitchen area, and a fireplace inside a gazebo with cozy outdoor seating in the backyard.</p><p>John Cena height can no longer increase again sadly but his net worth and other ventures have the tendency to increase over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmo6eYo3qksc2aZKGdmZy1tXnHqK5mrJGhuW610maroZ1dm7yzucSrZLCvlWLAtrzEq6qtmaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
