Both of his parents are&nbsp;natives of Ghana and had immigrated to the United Kingdom. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>As a result, the comedian possesses African ethnicity, while his nationality is British.&nbsp;His father&nbsp;Joseph Dapaah&nbsp;is a doctor by profession.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even though England remains his birthplace, the rapper hasn't forgotten his roots yet. He also visited Ghana in 2017 to spend time with his grandmother, who still resides there. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Michael Dapaah spends time with his grandmother during a visit to Ghana in 2017</strong> (Photo: myjoyonline.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The 28-year-old artist is&nbsp;also the eldest child in the family.

In 2012, he had even jokingly tweeted about wanting his future wife to resemble Amerian singer, Faith Evans.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But,&nbsp;it's 2019 already, and no news or reports have surfaced&nbsp;that hint towards his marriage.

When asked if he regretted cheating, the songwriter left the interviewer in shock with an unexpected answer.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the words of the rapper,&nbsp;he cheated on his girlfriends&nbsp;even after getting caught. Although he didn't share details of his girlfriends,&nbsp;it did showcase his lack of commitment. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>On top of that, if these patterns continue,&nbsp;fans won't be seeing Michael getting&nbsp;married anytime soon.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Net Worth, Earning</h2><p style=text-align:justify>As of now, the YouTuber retains an impressive net worth of $ 1 million.
