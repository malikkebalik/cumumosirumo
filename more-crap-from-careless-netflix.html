Netflix has padded its catalog of cinematic background noise some more with “Murder Mystery 2,” the instantly forgettable sequel to its rancid whodunit comedy starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler as married crime solvers. 
movie review MURDER MYSTERY 2 Running time: 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence, bloody images, strong language, suggestive material and smoking). On Netflix.
In the first film, the Spitzes (who, in an early indicator of James Vanderbilt’s script’s level of humor, a pilot calls the Sh-tzes) stumbled into amateur sleuthing like Miss Marple."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sandler jokingly, unbearably calls it “the Arc de Tree Hump?”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">At the Maharaja’s island wedding, the Spitzes are thrust into another silly murder case. <span class=credit>Scott Yamano/Netflix © 2023</span></figure><p>“I don’t want these buffoons involved anymore!,” announces Claudette.&nbsp;</p><p>As Aniston and Sandler are so uncharacteristically charmless and unfunny here while they scream and flail around Paris, we can’t help but agree with her.</p><p>In the City of Lights, Audrey and Nick become suspects themselves after the drop-off is bungled, and the French police are on the hunt for them. So, they must find the kidnapper and prove their innocence.&nbsp;</p><p>They stop by some notable Paris spots along the way, such as the Opera Garnier, which they don’t take advantage of as fabulously as the new “John Wick: Chapter 4” does.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Audrey (Jennifer Aniston) and Nick (Adam Sandler) search Paris for the Maharaja’s kidnapper. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>The biggest action sequence — still meh — in director Jeremy Garelick’s movie goes down at the Eiffel Tower and its famous restaurant, which brings to mind the worst-reviewed MGM James Bond flick of all time, “A View To A Kill.”&nbsp;</p><p>At least that Eiffel Tower chase had Roger Moore and Grace Jones.</p><p>When the identity of the murderer is revealed and and they suffer their eventual demise, the whole business is painfully uninteresting.</p><p>Netflix also is responsible for the “Knives Out” series, and while “Glass Onion” <a href=#>didn’t make my eyes water</a>, Rian Johnson’s send-up of Agatha Christie is leagues better than this formulaic, soulless schlock.&nbsp;</p><p>The streamer’s “Murder Mystery 2” amounts to nothing more than a free vacation for Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmbGlfosKzsMSrZKaxo6mys8WMa2Srnaaesrh5zKipnmWTp66xecWrpqZlk5a%2FprjErKpmppWps62112g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
