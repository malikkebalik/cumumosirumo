An worldwide criminal organization is the Sinaloa Cartel. In addition, he is among the world’s most formidable narcotics smugglers.</p><p>El Chapo began collaborating with “Héctor Luis Palma Salazar” around the late 1970s. In order to transport drugs across Sinaloa and into the USA, he thus assisted Salazar in mapping routes. Later on, he was Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo’s logistician supervisor. But following Gallardo’s imprisonment in 1988, he started his own cartel.</p><p>Chapo oversaw operations that produced, smuggled, and transported massive amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana into the USA and Europe, the two biggest users in the world. Chapo did this by becoming the first to employ long-distance tunnels close to borders and distribution cells. Because of it, he was able to export more drugs to the United States than any other trafficker in history.</p><h3>Furthermore</h3><p>In addition, he accumulated enormous wealth and influence via his leadership of the cartel; from 2009 to 2013, Forbes named him among the world’s most influential individuals.

And, the U.S. for information leading to his capture, and he was arrested in Mexico in the year 2014. Additionally, in 2015, he broke out of his jail cell through a tunnel that friends had dug into it before he was formally sentenced.</p><p>In addition, he was seized again by Mexican authorities in 2016 after a gunfight, and he was extradited to the United States a year later. All the same, he was convicted in 2019 of several felonies connected to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel. He was therefore given a life sentence and imprisoned at ADX Florence, Colorado, in the United States.</p><h2>Is Bernarda Guzmán Loera married?</h2><p>Regretfully, there is no information available on the personal or private life of Bernarda Guzmán Loera.
