We are seated — yes, seated — and uncertain, like schoolchildren hauled into assembly or sinners at Sunday church.</p><p>The venue choice later becomes the topic of much debate among punters post-gig. And now the singer himself awkwardly acknowledges the formality of the Melbourne Recital Centre set-up. But somehow it seems right. We know we’re not here for a standard gig. When the former Fleet Foxes drummer takes the stage as Father John Misty it’s more than a concert; it’s theatre. It’s Tillman shimmying, sashaying, thrusting. Tillman falling to his knees. Tillman caressing a microphone stand, twirling it around his body, and throwing it to the ground before it snaps back up to his hand with one effortless kick. It’s his droll one-liners. Every song’s a self-contained act and Tillman the star. It’s part tragedy, part comedy, and wholly enthralling.</p><p>Something spiritual is happening, too. And it’s here the space — with its earthy tones, and high-ceilings made of Australian-timber that have you feeling cocooned inside a tree trunk — really adds to the effect. The American is on his knees, further scuffing his worn-out skinny-leg jeans. We surrender, too, motionless in our seats and ready for our Father to take us on a mind-bending journey. Above him coloured beams of light, like 3D lotuses, add to the psychedelic effect; we are moved to a higher place. And like those blinding lights, the ideas come close to overwhelming; it’s music made to open the mind. We sit with heads tilted back, eyes closed — questioning the state of the world. But just as the thoughts stray too near existential crisis territory the tone abruptly changes.</p><p>Our moustachioed music minister strokes his facial hair.</p><p>He wants to know what is our generation’s obsession with the mo’, anyway?</p><p>Don’t we realise they’re more fitting of some kind of sicko sex pest?</p><p>During a brief pause in <span id=U63213986253G0G>When You’re Smiling and Astride Me</span>, a man yells out “I love you, Josh”.</p><p>To that, Tillman quips “A random male’s voice in the darkness- yeah, that’s why I started doing this … and now I’m knee deep”.</p><p>And when the feedback screeches, he welcomes us to the “noise-jazz portion” of the night without missing a beat.</p><p>It’s moments like this that prove Tillman isn’t afraid to take the piss — importantly — out of himself. The self-deprecation helps endear the audience and adds warmth to the singer’s sometimes too-cool persona. It’s also a reminder that no matter how bad the world may be there is always an opportunity for laughter. Likewise, peppering the performance with sudden upbeat bursts of music helps avoid a deep depression. The theme of his latest album, <span id=U63213986253i5>Pure Comedy</span>, is really anything but what the title suggests. And, with the first four songs played coming from that album, the mood at the start looks set to remain sombre. It is a welcome relief, therefore, to later hear favourites from the more lighthearted 2015 album.</p><p>But it’s also a song from that record that becomes the only source of disappointment. C<span id=U63213986253t2B>hateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins) </span>normally sounds like falling in love. But tonight it is rushed; Tillman lacks passion and appears eager to just get it over with. We are left feeling like a woman whose lover has rushed through the metaphorical entree in order to quickly reap the rewards of the main course. It’s quite a blow to an otherwise generous performance.</p><p>All is forgiven when Tillman invites us to our feet part-way through <span id=U63213986253esD>Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings.</span> We feel freed and burst out of our seats. We melt while he gets into the front row and suggestively gestures during <span id=U632139862539UB>I love You, Honeybear</span>. When the band leaves the stage we stomp and demand more. They returns and deliver the promised “bangers”. The show ends on the <span id=U6321398625307>The Ideal Husband</span>. And with that Father John Misty proves he’s the master of knowing just what people wanna hear.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a352ed106300c274a8b1c7be48e1d62a width=1280 height=720 alt="Powderfinger reunite at Splendour in the Grass" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e8yuqqKbX5uutbTEq2Sjp5ijeq610q2wZqSZnLW1v4yup2allaGvsMHRp5xmqpWYtrWty2aanqakp7JwusSwqmarpKS%2FunvEn5qca5JngKN8lp1tnGyUa7B2fMVwm2qdZ5h%2BooGYaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
