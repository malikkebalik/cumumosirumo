I‚Äôve been staying so positive and optimistic about this whole situation, taking one day at a time.. so please try not to worry about me! Even after surgery yesterday I‚Äôve been in great spirits. I‚Äôm going to be okay I promise. I‚Äôm the one ball wonder, quality over quantity baby. #fuckcancer."</p><p>Following the news, fans flooded social media with messages wishing for Brock's speedy recovery.
