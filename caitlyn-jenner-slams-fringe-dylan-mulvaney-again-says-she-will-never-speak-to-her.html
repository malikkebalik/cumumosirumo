She is not. She is bouncing around all over the place. I have nothing in common with her,” she added. “The fringe is the worst thing that can happen to the trans community and the media only wants to report on that because of the sensationalization of it and honestly that’s got to stop,” Jenner continued. “I am glad the position I am at today that I can be a voice of reason about what is going on out there,” she noted while speaking to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'This is an outrage': Caitlyn Jenner slams Nike's endorsement deal with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Boycott their products': Internet fumes as Dylan Mulvaney appears in Olay Women ad after Nike and BudLight</a></p><h2 class=split>Caitlyn Jenner slammed Nike’s endorsement deal with Dylan Mulvaney</h2><p>Prior to her latest comments, Jenner expressed her disappointment with Nike for offering an endorsement to Mulvaney instead of Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix. “As someone that grew up in awe of what Phil Knight did, it is a shame to see such an iconic American company go so woke! We can be inclusive but not at the expense of the mass majority of people, and have some decency while being inclusive. This is an outrage,” she wrote on Twitter at the time.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>As someone that grew up in awe of what Phil Knight did, it is a shame to see such an iconic American company go so woke!

She also tagged Nike Women while endorsing the brand’s new collection of Zenvy leggings and Alate bra. “Home for a moment and leaning into cozy workout wear life with @nikewomen’s newest Zenvy leggings and Alate bra! They’re so comfortable and buttery soft, perfect for workouts and everyday wear! #feelyourall #teamnike #nikepartner” Mulvaney wrote. The Broadway star’s collaboration with the brand irked several conservatives, including Jenner. The criticism involving Nike came after Mulvaney’s partnership with Bud Light beer sparked major backlash online and prompted the company’s vice president Alissa Heinerscheid to take a forced leave of absence.</p><h2 class=split>Caitlyn Jenner has been a vocal critic of Dylan Mulvaney</h2><p>Jenner has been vocal about her criticism of Mulvaney long before the latter started gaining endorsement deals with popular brands. The feud goes back to October 2022 when the former called out Mulvaney for her “normalize the bulge” campaign in reference to women having bulges. “There is a difference between acceptance and tolerance, and normalizing exposing your genitals in a public way and a public place. I do not support that at all, in the slightest. Dylan…congrats your trans with a p****s,” Jenner wrote at the time.</p><p>Jenner came out in 2015 by announcing her transition in a Vanity Fair profile before physically transitioning in 2017. She also appeared in the 2015 documentary ‘I Am Cait’ which documented her transition. The former athlete, who is known for her support of conservative politics, unsuccessfully ran for Governor of California in 2021 as a Republican member and finished 13th in the political race.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5Gewa3FzWahnqaemr9ursuaqq2rXZnGra3NZqSupKaWu6bFjJqdrZ2iYsCtrcymoKefXaO2rLGMnZyapA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
