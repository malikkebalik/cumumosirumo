The album was almost confirmed after Kanye premiered a video of the song ‘No Child Left Behind’ in a Beats advertisement that featured athlete Sha’Carri Richardson. The ad saw subtitles that clearly said ‘Donda this Friday’, referring to July 23. Much to everyone’s surprise, the ‘Life of a Pablo’ hitmaker then did not drop the album. He has not shared any official statement on the same yet but it is rumored that his new full-length record might be still in its final stages. MEAWW will keep you posted. &nbsp;</p><p>‘Donda’ is Kanye’s 10th studio album and is a follow-up to his 2019 gospel album called ‘Jesus Is King’, which included guest appearances from artists namely Clipse, Ty Dolla Sign, Kenny G, Fred Hammond, Ant Clemons, along with the Sunday Service Choir. Kanye’s album won the Top Christian Album and Top Gospel Album awards at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards and also scooped the Best Contemporary Christian Music Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021.</p><h2 class=split>‘Donda is still getting mixed RN, this s**t never coming out’</h2><p>Social media users, who were eagerly waiting for the album, got real mad when ‘Donda’ was not up for streaming on Apple Music and Spotify. One optimistic user, however, said, “Relax all Kanye is just doing his last minute fixes with his perfectionist a** #DONDA.” Whereas, one made fun of the album not dropping and shared, “Ever since Kanye didn’t drop DONDA, i haven’t been able to sleep, my hairs been falling out from the stress, it hurts to eat due to how much I’ve been grinding my teeth. If Ye doesn’t drop this album soon I’m gonna have to do something about it.” Another used tweeted, “Word on the street is that Donda is still getting mixed rn , this s**t never coming out.”<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, one tweeted, “Kanye f**king West thank you for not dropping Donda today and not taking 97% of my streams away.” One posted, “People seem to forget kanye only announces a date not a time, he runs on kanye time both Ye and Kids See Ghosts didnt drop till 8am #DONDA.” Another added, “Kanye can take as long as he wants to drop donda it just means it’ll be better,” while another concluded, “Donda is never coming out. but ily and all my homies. i ate 2 edibles earlier and my body was so f**king vibey.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Relax all Kanye is just doing his last minute fixes with his perfectionist ass <a href=#>#DONDA</a></p>— Uncle Luke (@Unc82385794) <a href=#>July 23, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ever since Kanye didn’t drop DONDA, i haven’t been able to sleep, my hairs been falling out from the stress, it hurts to eat due to how much I’ve been grinding my teeth.
