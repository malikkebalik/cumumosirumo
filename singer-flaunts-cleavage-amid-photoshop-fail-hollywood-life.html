SO sexy! Mariah also wore a pair of super high stilettos with black sunglasses to match and a pair of distressed blue jeans. Who ever knew that grocery shopping could be SO glamorous? Mariah didn’t come alone though; she was escorted by a large entourage as well!</p><h3>Mariah Carey: See More Pics Of The Singer Here</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>In addition to images taken of her leaving the store, Mariah also shared pics of her own on Instagram on Nov. 25, of her inside shopping.&nbsp;In one of the sexy selfies, Mariah posed with two pineapples in from of her boobs! Scandalous! The “Touch My Body” artist also was sweet enough to take a couple of pics with some random shoppers. SO nice! “Just a regular day at the grocery store in Hawaii,” she captioned one pic of her smiling with a long line of customers who were hovering over her in awe!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BNNywFPhWqI/?taken-by=mariahcarey</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BNNyk7JhLcy/?taken-by=mariahcarey</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Mariah’s grocery shopping spree came only hours&nbsp;before the singer uploaded an image that was noticeably Photoshopped. While the other previous images seemed to be untouched, the image of her holding a pie, was obviously edited to make her look thinner and more curvaceous. Yikes! Many fans mocked and slammed Mariah for her fail, but luckily she&nbsp;had her twins and ex-husband <strong>Nick Cannon</strong>, 36, to cheer her up for the holidays!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The happy family spent the holidays together with a big Thanksgiving feast&nbsp;prepared by Mariah’s family members! SO sweet! Although Mariah was attacked on social media for her editing skills, it’s clear to see that she didn’t&nbsp;need to retouch a thing because she’s already &nbsp;incredible!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Mariah’s untouched images?
