Another onstage project they starred in was a psychological thriller called "Animal." They portrayed a struggling married couple, Rachel and Tom.</p><p class=Fg>Spector and Hal also starred in two films together, the 2016 movie "Christine" and the 2017 film "Permission." Besides collaborating onstage and in front of the camera, Hal and Spector also started a family together.</p><p class=Fg>They welcomed their daughter in 2018. Hal once <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/27/rebecca-hall-race-regret-personal-history-any-family-legacy-of-passing-very-tricky>shared </a>that she "loves the television," so perhaps one day she will find a career in the entertainment industry like her parents.</p><p class=Fg>Although the pair have worked on past projects and are raising their daughter together, they prefer to separate their personal and professional lives.</p><p class=Fg>For a New York Times <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/theater/rebecca-hall-and-morgan-spector-together-onstage-and-off.html>article </a>about their relationship and work, Spector and Hal chose to have separate interviews with the writer because they want to be judged as individual artists instead of a "two-for-one special."</p><p class=Fg>So far, it seems their tactics have worked as the actors have impressive <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/morgan-spector-the-gilded-age-4626407/>careers </a>independent of their partners. Hal's most notable films include "Vicky Cristina Barcelona," "The Town," "The Awakening," "Iron Man 3," and "Godzilla vs. Kong."</p><p class=Fg>She also recently made her directorial debut for the film "Passing." Hal wrote the screenplay based on the Nella Larsen novel of the same title. The movie is about a Black woman in 1920 New York, whose life gets turned upside down when she reconnects with a childhood friend.</p><p class=Fg>Spector has an equally exciting career with credits in TV shows such as "<a class="Xd a" href=#>Suits</a>," "Pearson," "The Mist," "Homeland," and "Boardwalk Empire." He also featured in "The Drop" and "A Vigilante."</p><p class=Fg>The accomplished actor's acting career started at age eight at a community theater. He later attended acting school at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. After moving to New York, he made his Broadway debut in 2010 in "A View From The Bridge."</p><p class=Fg>It seems the former stage actor has transitioned to working behind the camera well. His most recent project is portraying George Russell in the period drama, "The Gilded Age."</p><p class=Fg>Spector and his <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://decider.com/2022/02/01/the-giled-age-carrie-coon-morgan-spector-hot/>onscreen wife</a> Carrie Coon, who plays Bertha Russell, have already received rave reviews for their portrayal of the "young money" married couple, who are finding their place in 1880s New York.</p><p class=Fg>More importantly, fans love the dynamic between the ruthless railroad tycoon and his wife and their steamy and sensual storyline in "The Downton Abbey" creator Julian Fellowes's latest project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtvb2loZXq4tM5moKxlnaS%2FqK3NZqqpnZOpvLN5xp6rZqyfYrivu9ZmmqGZoqK2b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
