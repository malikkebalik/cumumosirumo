Her career spans across various broadcasting networks such as Fox and ESPN, contributing significantly to her current net worth.</p><p>As of late-2016, Pam Oliver’s net worth is estimated at $6 million, primarily amassed through her successful journey in broadcast journalism. Her annual earnings from NFL’s broadcasting team reportedly stand at $2 million. Additionally, she has also made appearances on the radio. It is anticipated that her wealth will continue to grow as she advances in her career.</p><p>During her formative years, Pam’s family moved across the United States due to her father’s involvement in the United States Air Force. Having lived in multiple states like California, Florida, Washington, Michigan, and Texas, she developed a strong inclination towards sports and news shows rather than children’s programs. She excelled in basketball, tennis, and track and field during her time at Niceville High School. Pursuing this passion, she continued her athletic pursuits at Florida A&M University, where she achieved the status of a college All-American in the mile relay and the 400-meters, graduating with a degree in broadcast journalism in 1984.</p><p>Commencing her career, she transitioned between various TV and radio stations. Starting as a news reporter at WALB in Albany, Georgia in 1985, she then moved to WAAY-TV in Alabama and WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York. In 1990, she joined WTVT in Tampa, Florida, assuming the role of a sports anchor. Continuing her ascent, she joined KHOU-TV a year later, remaining in the capacity of a sports anchor. The pivotal year of 1993 saw her become a part of the ESPN television network, subsequently moving to Fox Sports as a sideline reporter two years later. She became a part of the network’s top broadcasting team alongside Pat Sumerall and John Madden. This trend continued as she also joined TNT in 2005 to fulfill the role of a sideline reporter during the NBA Playoffs, contributing to the consistent rise of her net worth.</p><p>In 2014, it was initially announced that Pam’s sideline reporting tenure for the NFL would conclude at the end of that season, as she was set to transition to the #2 NFL broadcasting team. Contrary to this, in the following year, it was disclosed that her sideline reporting assignment had been extended through the 2016 season, while she worked as part of the #2 broadcasting team. In recognition of her numerous accomplishments, she was honored with the “Outstanding Woman in Journalism” award by Ebony.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Pam has been married to freelance producer Alvin Whitney since 1990. Notably, she faced criticism during a Seahawks and 49ers NFC Championship Game when her hairstyle evoked comparisons to the Star Wars character Chewbacca. However, she later emphasized the need for attention to be directed towards her work rather than her appearance.</p><p><br>﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Pam Oliver</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 10, 1961</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Dallas, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 9 in (1.77 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Sportscaster</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Niceville High School, Florida A&M University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Alvin Whitney (m. 1990)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>John Oliver, Mary Oliver</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Pamela Donielle Oliver</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1829261/</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Fox NFL, NBA on TNT, Fox NFL Sunday</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>60 Minutes Sports</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Herself – Correspondent (segment “The Stars in Stripes”) / Herself – Correspondent (segment “Sneakerhead”) / Herself – Correspondent (segment “Big Vince”) / …</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl XLVIII</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Herself – Sideline Reporter</td></tr><tr><td>Enlisted</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>The Best Man Holiday</td><td>2013</td><td></td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>A Football Life</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl XLV</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Herself – Sideline Reporter</td></tr><tr><td>Cubed</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>D.L.
