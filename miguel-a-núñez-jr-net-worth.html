Núñez, Jr. Wiki Biography</h2><p>Born on August 11, 1964 in New York City, Miguel A. Núñez, Jr. is an American actor, comedian, and executive producer of African-American and Dominican descent. He is mostly recognized for his roles in “Juwanna Mann”(2002) and “Tour of Duty”(1987).</p><p>As of early 2017, Miguel Núñez’s net worth is estimated to be over $500,000, primarily amassed from his acting career that kicked off in the mid-1980s.</p><h3>Miguel A. Núñez, Jr. Net Worth: $500,000</h3><p>After leaving New York City, Núñez spent a significant part of his youth in Wilson, North Carolina, under the care of his grandparents. He attended high school there before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. His journey to success was not immediate, as he struggled for a while, taking on odd jobs, including telemarketing for the LA Lakers. Eventually, he landed his first on-screen role as “Jock #2” in 1984’s “National Lampoon’s Joy of Sex.”</p><p>In 1985, Núñez appeared in two roles in well-known horror movie series, namely “Friday the 13th: A New Beginning” and as Spider in “The Return of the Living Dead.” He continued to secure steady acting gigs, often in small, unnamed roles in various projects, both low and high budget. In 1987, he had a brief appearance in the opening scene of “Lethal Weapon,” although he was cut from the final version of the film. As a consolation, he made an appearance in the second sequel and had a line of speech.</p><p>His career picked up in 2002 when he appeared in the “Scooby-Doo” movie and took on the lead role in the comedy “Juwanna Mann.” He made frequent appearances alongside renowned actor and comedian Eddie Murphy in films like “Life,” “Pluto Nash,” and “Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps,” further adding to his net worth.</p><p>In 2006, Núñez landed a recurring role alongside Matt LeBlanc in the second season of the “Friends” spin-off, “Joey,” playing Joey’s best friend, Zach, though he left the show before its conclusion, missing the last five episodes of the season. Despite the show’s limited success, his appearance on a prime-time network show, albeit short-lived, likely contributed to his overall net worth.</p><p>Núñez currently has several movies in post-production scheduled for a 2017 release. He has various producer credits, particularly for short or video movies, and TV shows including “Homeboys in Outer Space,” a series for which he also wrote an episode. In 2012, he co-created the show “Belle’s” with Ed. Weinberger and wrote several episodes, starring Keith David and Elise Neal. The show followed an African American family running a restaurant in Atlanta, although it concluded after one season, during which Núñez also played a role. In 2004, he directed “Up Against the 8 Ball,” a comedy about two college girls playing pool to finance their education.</p><p>On the personal front, Núñez tied the knot with Yulanda Simon in 1994, and the couple has two daughters. His philanthropic efforts include assisting at Union Rescue Mission, an organization aiding homeless individuals in the LA area.</p><p><br>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Miguel A.
