For his powerful performance as Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton in&nbsp;Judas and the Black Messiah, Kaluuya is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nominated </a>at the 93rd Academy Awards for Best&nbsp;Supporting&nbsp;Actor. The prestigious ceremony will be held on April 25, 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actor earlier&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">won</a>&nbsp;Golden Globes&nbsp;and&nbsp;Critics Choice Awards&nbsp;for his performance, which he describes as ‘’the part that has taught him the most about himself.’’ This is his second Oscar nomination, following his Best Actor nomination for 2017’s horror-thriller&nbsp;Get Out, another zeitgeist film that he got recognition for.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Kaluuya’s Reaction to Academy Awards Nomination</h2><p>According to the actor, Fred Hampton was a “beacon of a being,” lighting everyone he came into contact with his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inspiring message.</a>&nbsp;Despite his ability to command every stage and the ability to captivate a global audience, he was robbed of his chance. With his laugh, his mind, his zeal, and his love, he created strategies that not only embraced and uplifted the black community but united other cultures.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Today, I am humbled to be nominated for portraying a man whose principles I deeply respect and for guiding me to walk in his footsteps.</p><p>On March 31, 2021, Kaluuya talked about what awards recognition means to him in a recent Deadline video series, considering it beautiful to be appreciated by the people who watch cinema.&nbsp;</p><p>The British actor mentioned the detailed research he did to play Hampton and how he was mighty impressed with Hampton’s rise to be the Chairman of the&nbsp;Black Panthers&nbsp;(Chicago Chapter) before he was shot and killed at 21.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He also addressed Hampton’s mother and son’s contribution in influencing his success. Kaluuya, who approached the role with a distinctly American accent, then&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">discussed</a>&nbsp;recreating Hampton’s powerful speeches and learning the ability to deliver them in a manner similar to that of a professional singer — “the talking version of singing,” he called it, citing James Brown and Gospel as examples.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Kaluuya’s Masterful Performances</h2><p>While the 32-year-old has over forty-five projects credited to his name, it was in 2015 he landed his breakthrough role. Over the last few years, Kaluuya’s career graph has experienced significant growth from a small yet impactful role in&nbsp;Sicario&nbsp;to Oscar-nominated appearances. Below are a few of Kaluuya's prominent performances:&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Sicario (2015)&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2><p>Kaluuya&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played</a>&nbsp;a rookie FBI agent Reggie Wayne in Denis Villeneuve’s 2015 thriller&nbsp;Sicario. Reggie, Emily Blunt’s Kate Macer’s best friend and bureau partner, isn’t in the movie that much.</p><p>But when he is, he offers a sense of calm that almost makes the audience forget about the sinister events waiting to unfold between the US government agents and the Mexican drug cartels. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This work of his is worth revisiting time and again because of his almost-perfect Texan accent.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Get Out (2017)</h2><p>When the horror-thriller was released in 2017, it was an instant success, propelling its leading man Kaluuya into the spotlight. Kaluuya’s performance in the movie earned him an Oscar and&nbsp;Golden Globe&nbsp;nomination for Best Actor.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The hypnosis scene where his character Chris Washington (a photographer) first discovers the phrase is as memorable for its disturbing visuals as it is for Kaluuya’s acting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though his body is paralyzed, his face betrays every ounce of Chris’s heartache and sorrow.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Widows&nbsp;(2018)</h2><p>In Steve McQueen’s heist movie,&nbsp;Widows, the actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played&nbsp;</a>Jatemme Manning, an intimidating and ruthless enforcer in his brother’s Chicago gang.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the remarkable scenes in the movie is when Manning confronts&nbsp;two gang members after they allow a group of robbers to steal $2 million. He lets the two men rap in an empty gym and pretends to enjoy the performance before he takes out his gun and shoots one in the head while shooting the other in the back as he attempts to run.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Black Panther&nbsp;(2018)</h2><p>In&nbsp;Black Panther, there are many instances where Kaluuya flexes his acting pedigree. His most notable one is when King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda after failing to catch Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis).&nbsp;</p><p>In the movie, Klaue had murdered his parents years before, and T’Challa had promised him (W’Kabi) justice. But when he learns of the mission’s failure, his confidence and enthusiasm quickly transform into hurt and disappointment.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He locks his eyes on his soon-to-be former friend as he turns and walks away, reinforcing his sense of betrayal.&nbsp;</p><h2>Queen & Slim (2019)</h2><p><span>In the 2019 modern-day Bonnie & Clyde story,&nbsp;Queen & Slim, the London native&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">portrays</a>&nbsp;Slim where he and Jodie Turner-Smith (Queen) flee the scene after murdering a cop.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>Slim is a conflicted and frightened&nbsp;young man&nbsp;whose life is changed in a matter of seconds. But he knows there’s no turning back. In the act of self-defense, he ends up killing the officer at the end.</span></p><p><span>Kaluuya's outstanding performance as a man on the run from his past is a treat to watch like his other noteworthy performances.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mur7XEpWSkmZyqwrqtjHJqq5xdlrCisMSmsGaZp5a%2FpXrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
