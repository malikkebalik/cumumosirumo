As they explained it, Kate was actually Eddie and Kyle's college professor, who encouraged Eddie to pursue his dream and create a brand and helped him get in touch with Kyle, who handles the social media end of the business. With 720,000 in lifetime sales, all the sharks agreed that they certainly had a superior product on hand. But when it came to putting their money where their mouth is, each of them seemed to back out one by one, the main issue being that the brand's story didn't reflect quickly, making it a hard sell when it came to other existing brands in the market. At the same time, Kate reasoned that the brand was popular with the Hispanic community; they target through their tortillas. However, with the market quite saturated, it wasn't good enough for the Sharks.</p><p>Nevertheless, Kate was persistent and even spoke about her late husband and her promise to help Eddie and Kyle. Finally, however, the Sharks had to ask her to wrap up with time running out. While saying her final thank yous, Cuban cut her off and told them to go, which did not sit well with fans.&nbsp;</p><p>"Great story. They'll do well. Just foiled by the classic chicken-and-tortilla problem. #SharkTank" tweeted a fan. "If it's the beginning and you can relate to them, why not help them? #SharkTank" added another. "@ABCSharkTank oh ok Mark sees a future in the diaper product but not in this tortilla co. ? lol #SharkTank" asked a fan. "Watching #SharkTank and the way @mcuban just snapped at them gives #texans a bad name. Disappointed!" noted another. "What happened? Why didn't they edit out Cuban yelling at her? Wow! LOL" asked another fan.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Great story. They'll do well.
