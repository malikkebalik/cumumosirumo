Fans took <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>videos</a> of Priyanka, 41, walking into the stadium waving to the crowd and pumping her fists in excitement. The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Citadel</a>&nbsp;star looked gorgeous in a yellow top with ruffled sleeves and matching leather pants. She let her brunette hair down and rocked a silver necklace and earrings.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Priyanka was there to see Nick perform with his brothers&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kevin Jonas</a></strong>, 35, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe Jonas</a></strong>, 34. Nick blew out the candles on his surprise birthday cake while on stage in another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fan video</a> from the show. The brothers<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> embraced several times</a> during their concert, which they’ve been doing frequently amidst Joe’s divorce from his wife&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>, 27.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sophie wasn’t at the Omaha concert, obviously, and Kevin’s wife <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Danielle Jonas</a></strong>, 37, didn’t go to the show either. But Priyanka was there to support her husband and her brother-in-laws. The actress further celebrated Nick on his birthday with a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram tribute</a> that included pictures of the happy couple, as well as a snapshot of Nick feeding their 1-year-old daughter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Malti</strong></a>, 1.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Celebrating you is the greatest joy of my life,” Priyanka wrote in her message to Nick. “You have pushed me in ways I didn’t know was possible.. shown me peace like I have never known.. and loving like only you can.. I love you my birthday guy! I hope all your dreams always come true… Happy birthday baby.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>While Nick and Kevin’s marriages seem to be thriving, the same sadly can’t be said for Joe’s. The “Cake by the Ocean” singer&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> from Sophie after over four years of marriage on September 5. The exes, who have<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> two daughters together</a>, broke their silence on their split when they <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a joint statement</a> to Instagram on September 6.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“After four wonderful years of marriage, we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” the statement read. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision, and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/priyanka-nick-birthday-concert-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Joe has been busy on tour with his brothers since the news broke of his impending divorce. At the band’s show in Phoenix on Sept. 7, Nick called Joe his <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“favorite person”</a> in the midst of the drama over Joe’s marriage. The audience clapped and cheered for Joe after hearing what Nick said about his brother.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Sophie, meanwhile, has been living in Spain <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filming a new TV show</a>. Aside from her and Joe’s joint statement on the divorce from Sept. 6, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Game of Thrones</a> star has stayed quiet about the dissolution of her relationship. Joe and Sophie first met in 2016 and got married in Las Vegas in May 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5BxZqmqma6ur7fAZpqhp6Cnrm6t062cp5yjYrewusCsZJuqn6m1pr7SZpqoppOav7V5zaKapGWSnr%2B1tMOasGaumZmysHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
