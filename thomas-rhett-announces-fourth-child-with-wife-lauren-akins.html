Love you so much,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@laur_akins</a>&nbsp;we always wanted a big thanksgiving table.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Rhett and Akins</h2><p>Rhett and Akins’&nbsp;love story sounds like one that's&nbsp;straight out of a fairytale. The two first met when they were they were&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first graders</a>&nbsp;growing up in Georgia. They became close friends in the years that followed. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>As teenagers, they dated briefly but remained good&nbsp;friends when Akins decided they were better off as friends. The pair dated other people for a while and almost married different people until Rhett’s father-in-law&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">intervened</a>&nbsp;with a threat.&nbsp;</p><p>Her dad called me and said, ‘If you don’t come over here tonight and tell Lauren how you feel about her, then I’m going to tell her how you feel about her.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Rhett confessed he still had feelings for Akins, and they began dating again. After six months of dating, Rhett proposed to his then-girlfriend over dinner at her favorite Nashville restaurant, Giovanni, with a wine bottle that had “Marry Me” written with a Sharpie marker. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Many felt the couple were too young to take such a big step, and Rhett Akins, the father of the groom who&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">echoed</a>&nbsp;the same sentiments, had a change of heart and realized the two were meant to be together when his son and daughter-in-law stared at each other the entire 20 minutes they exchanged their vows.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Following this announcement, the country crooner and the mom-to-be will&nbsp;become a family of 6 with three adorable <a href=# rel=follow>kids</a>, Willa Gray, Ada James, and Lennon Love.&nbsp;</p><h2>On Making Their Marriage Work</h2><p>While the two&nbsp;might look like the perfect couple on the outside,&nbsp;their marriage has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not</a> always been a fairytale bliss. In her memoir&nbsp;Live In Love,&nbsp;Akins gave fans an inside look into her relationship with Rhett and how they overcame obstacles to make their marriage work.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Akins&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled</a>&nbsp;when Rhett was focused on his music career and how she felt lonely and isolated. Rhett was busy touring the U.S while Akins was pregnant with Ada James and living in Uganda to complete their adoption process for Willa Gray.&nbsp;</p><p>During a phone call, Akins mentioned that the couple was living two completely different lives, and that was when they&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">realized</a>&nbsp;that they needed help. They&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sought</a>&nbsp;marriage counseling and revealed that they still keep in touch with their marriage counselor.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The duo is definitely in it for the long haul.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnpJ28rq3SZqmhnaSpeqK6zaisp5uVqHqnu9Srq6Flk522rbCMsKCtoF2stqexjKWYrqqVo3qit8inqmegpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
