serving two life sentences.</p><p>Prison officials found Griffin recorded Murdaugh, who read excerpts from a journal he kept while standing trial earlier this year for killing his wife, Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, Paul, in 2021.</p><p>Griffin intended to use information from the recordings for a three-part Fox docuseries titled “The Fall of the House of Murdaugh,” which featured an interview with Murdaugh’s surviving son, Buster, according to a report.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Convicted double murderer Alex Murdaugh lost

him in the future,” said Dennis Patterson, SCDOC assistant deputy director of operations, in an email to Griffin dated Aug. 30.</p><p>Inmates are prohibited from participating in interviews as the SDOC “believes that victims of a crime should not have to see or hear the person who victimized them or their family member on the news,” spokesperson Chrysti Shain said in a statement.</p><p>Hours after Murdaugh’s phone and tablet privileges were revoked on Aug. 9, he broke prison rules again when he used another inmate’s PIN number to make a phone call, according to the prison statement.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Alex Murdaugh’s attorney Jim Griffin (left) and prosecutor Creighton Waters listen to testimony during

opportunity to purchase authorized items like food — were revoked for 30 days.</p><p>Prison officials also said he’d no longer have access to his tablet, used for correctional purposes until the department determines when Murdaugh is able to regain the privilege following the infractions.</p><p>Murdaugh was convicted in March of two counts of murder following the savage slayings on his South Carolina farm in 2021.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Murdaugh also had his phone privileges taken away. <span class=credit>YouTube / Phone Calls
