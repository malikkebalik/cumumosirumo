She mentioned she got the movie's script right after writing about the struggle in her book.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It was like the universe kind of putting these things in my sphere to help me face, kind of dead on, a fear that I used to have," Collins recounted, revealing she had never dared to speak up on the matter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But the time had changed, and Collins admittedly wanted to spur a conversation on anorexia. "It's something that a lot of young women go through, and there's no shame in it," she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Variety</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Guildford native even added that the movie was about embracing the past and realizing it didn't define the present. "I&nbsp;think it's really important, and it shouldn't be that taboo," she stressed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Conflicting Response to Her Weight Loss&nbsp;</h2><p>As Collins visibly lost a good amount of her weight for the movie, the transformation met with conflicting responses.</p><p>In an interview with The Edit, as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported by Allure</a>, the stunning actress shared she received a compliment about her drastic weight loss.</p><p>As per her accounts, a woman her mom's age praised her for losing weight, stating, "I want to know what you're doing, you look great!" Taking the instance as a reference, Collins implied how society had wired women to view weight loss as a compliment.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Multiple magazines didn't want to put her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pictures&nbsp;on their stories</a>, let alone the covers, because they were concerned she wasn't healthy. The <a href=# rel=follow>Emily in Paris</a>&nbsp;star applauded their stance because she didn't want her fans to idolize skinny bodies.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZocZur86lo6Kmo2LEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
