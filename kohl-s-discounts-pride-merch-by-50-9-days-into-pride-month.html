up to 60% both in stores and online.</p><p>Kohl’s launched its 2023 Pride collection, dubbed “Show Love is Love Every Day,” ahead of Pride Month in June.</p><p>Rainbow-clad merchandise included T-shirts for adults saying “you do you,” as well as onesies for infants that say “happy pride” and a two-pack of baby bibs that read “proud of my family.”</p><p>Just nine days into Pride Month and Kohl’s is selling the items at severe price cuts — a move that comes after rival <a href=#>Target yanked some of its “PRIDE” collection from store shelves following a boycott</a> that wiped $12 million from the company’s value.</p><p>On Kohl’s website, many Pride-themed items were half-off — including a rainbow-studded denim jacket, once $65, that was listed on sale for $32.50, plus $20 Pride baseball caps going for $10 and pro-LGBTQ+ homeware halved from $29.99 to $14.99.</p><p>That pack of baby bibs were also selling for $11, down from $22.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Nine days into Pride Month and many of Kohl’s LGBTQ-themed items are half-off online, with discounts up to 60% in stores. <span class=credit>Christopher Sadowski</span></figure><p>At a Long Island, N.Y., outpost of the Wisconsin-based retailer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DailyMail.com</a> found items with sale stickers on them and on clearance racks where price cuts reached up to 60%.</p><p>One Pride T-shirt donning a sticker on its tag boasted a price cut from $12 to just $4, while a clearance rank encouraging shoppers to “seize the deals” offered an “additional 50% off already reduced clearance merchandise.”</p><p>Kohl’s did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.</p><p>Kohl’s, which has more than 1,100 stores across 49 states, is just the latest company to make an effort to stifle the fallout from its Pride collection.</p><p>Target triggered a boycott of its nearly 2,000 US outposts when it released its own Pride collection, which featured “tuck-friendly” swimwear for women and pro-LGBTQ+ messaging on children’s clothing that especially outraged its conservative customer base.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Online, pro-LGBTQ+ homeware at Kohl’s had prices halved from $29.99 to $14.99. <span class=credit>Kohl's</span></figure><p>Customers have accused Target of grooming children with the items — most recently alt-right rapper Forgiato Blow who’s&nbsp;<a href=#>topping iTunes chart with his new rap song, “Boycott Target.”</a></p><p>The song’s lyrics address an LGBTQ “agenda” that the rapper sings has gone “too far.”</p><p>Nearly one month after Target released “PRIDE,” the retailer can’t seem to catch a break.</p><p>Conservative voices may be quieting, but <a href=#>more than 200 LGBTQ groups angered by Target’s decision to pull Pride merch from its shelves</a> are now demanding the company “denounce extremists” and restock all the Pride items in stores and online.</p><p>The Human Rights Campaign, along with GLAAD,&nbsp;GLSEN and other&nbsp;groups, released a statement asking Target and other embattled&nbsp;<a href=#>businesses like Anheuser-Busch</a>&nbsp;to “reject and speak out against anti-LGBTQ+ extremism going into Pride Month.”</p><figure

Minneapolis-based retailer has suffered a similar fate to Bud Light, which was swept into the eye of a culture storm after an ill-fated partnership with trans social media star Dylan Mulvaney <a href=#>sent the beer brand’s sales plummeting</a>.</p><p>But even as Target and Bud Light battle negative publicity, <a href=#>they’ve continued to double down on their pro-Pride efforts.</a></p><p>Target, for example, is a platinum sponsor of NYC Pride 2023, which requires a $175,000 donation to achieve the status.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bud Light’s parent Anheuser-Busch is a sponsor of Pride celebrations in Chicago, San Francisco, Charlotte and elsewhere.</p><p class=postsid
