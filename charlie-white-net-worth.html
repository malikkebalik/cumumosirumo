At the age of five he began skating, and two years later ice dancing. He went to Roeper School in Birmingham, Michigan, and upon matriculation in 2005, he enrolled at the University of Michigan to study olitical science. While in college, he began playing ice hockey and distinguished himself as a player, leading the team to a state championship. However, he started to pursue his career as an ice dancer, and he quit playing ice hockey.</p><p>At the beginning of his career, Charlie competed internationally not only as a free skater, but also as an ice dancer. As a free skater, his first major success came when he won the bronze medal at the 2004 U.S. Championships on the junior level, after which he moved his focus to ice dancing. He competed with his childhood friend <a href=#>Meryl Davis</a>, and in their first season they won the silver medal at the Junior Olympics, and in the following season debuted at the 2001 U.S. Championships, finishing in 6th place, which marked the beginning of an increase of his net worth. His first big victory came in 2006, becoming a gold medalist at the U.S. Championships, and in the following season, he made his competitive debut at the senior 2006–07 ISU Grand Prix, finishing fourth. During the same season, Charlie won the NHK Trophy, where he and his partner became the first team which earned all level fours on their elements, and also became the winner of the Grand Prix title at the 2007 Trophée Eric Bompard, plus in the next year he won the silver title at the Four Continents Championships.</p><p>The 2009-2010 season was one of Charlie’s greatest, as he became a gold medalist at the National Championships, Nebelhorn Trophy, Rostelecom Cup and NHK Trophy, which qualified him for the Grand Prix Final, winning it. Since then, his career has only went upwards in net worth and popularity. During the next season, he won his second national title at the National Championships, and finished second at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he scored his personal best of 215.74. In the 2010-2011 season, he and his partner were undefeated, winning the World Figure Skating Championships, Four Continents and Grand Prix Final among other titles.</p><p>To speak further about Charlie’s career, in the forthcoming seasons the team stayed undefeated and reached enormous success, winning a number of titles, including the national title, Grand Prix Final, NHK Trophy, Grand Prix Skate America, US Classic title, and they also became gold medalists at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, after which he finished his competitive career. However, he still performs with his partner Meryl at various ice dancing shows, and participated in the reality TV show “Stars On Ice”.
