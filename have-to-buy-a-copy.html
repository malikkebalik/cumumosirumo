As they tentatively embark on a relationship, they both struggle to decipher the language of love — with consequences that are both comic and heartbreaking.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/GettyImages-1448272582.jpg><p>Martin’s book was one of 313 books <a href=#>removed from libraries</a> in the school district to comply with Florida law prohibiting titles that <a href=#>contain “sexual conduct,”</a> according to a list that was cataloged by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC 2</a>.</p><p>Collier County Public Schools chief communication Officer Chad Oliver told Fox News Digital, “Determination for removal of some books was made based on parameters of&nbsp;FL House Bill 1069, as well as other district review processes such as out-of-date titles that have minimal to no circulation. The changes are effective immediately; however, the district is doing an additional review of the titles.&nbsp;If it is determined these materials should remain in the CCPS collection, then CCPS media specialists will be notified.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/NYPICHPDPICT000056588439.jpg><p>Oliver also said, “The State&nbsp;has made clear the potential punishment (third-degree felony FL Statute 847.12) for non-compliance,” and pointed to the statute’s language:</p><p>“‘Sexual conduct’ means actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, or sadomasochistic abuse; actual or simulated lewd exhibition of the genitals; actual physical contact with a person’s clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if such person is a female, breast with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of either party; or any act or conduct which constitutes sexual battery or simulates that sexual battery is being or will be committed. A mother’s breastfeeding of her baby does not under any circumstance constitute ‘sexual conduct.’”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaXBfo7K4v46sq56ulWK6or7ToqVmrKKkua2%2FjJ%2BjqKqZma5uv8KhpqikXZm2tMDRopqtZZakv2681KWjoqaXYrWqv4ybpqijXZu%2FsLmMpaCbqpGntqa%2FjKGYr51dqbxurtSyZJplk6S9uns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
